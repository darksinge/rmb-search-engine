6        (2) (a)  Subsection (1)(b)(ii) may be exercised only if the Office of Recovery Services has

7    mailed written notice to the taxpayer's last-known address or the address on file under Section

8    62A-11-304.4, stating:

9        (i)  the amount of child support that is past-due as of the date of the notice or other

16        (b)  If an overpayment of tax is credited against a past-due child support obligation in

17    accordance with Subsection (1)(b)(ii) in noncash assistance cases, the Office of Recovery Services

20    provided to that family.

21        (c)  The Department of Human Services shall establish rules to implement this subsection,

22    including procedures, in accordance with the other provisions of this section, to ensure prompt

4        (b)  The court receiving the overpayment applied as bail shall order withdrawal of the

5    warrant for arrest of the taxpayer if the case is one for which a personal appearance of the taxpayer

6    is not required and if the dollar amount of the overpayment represents the full dollar amount of

7    bail.  In all other cases, the court receiving the overpayment applied as bail is not required to order

8    the withdrawal of the warrant of arrest of the taxpayer during the 40-day period, and the taxpayer

9    may be arrested on the warrant.  However, the bail amount shall be reduced by the amount of tax

10    overpayment received by the court.

11        (c)  If the taxpayer fails to respond to the notice described in Subsection (3), or to resolve

12    the warrant within 40 days after the mailing under that subsection, the overpayment applied as bail

14    with the commission.  The court may then issue another warrant or allow the original warrant to

15    remain in force if:

16        (i)  the taxpayer has not complied with an order of the court;

22    taxpayer, the bail amount shall be remitted to the taxpayer.

23        (6)  Any balance shall be refunded immediately to the taxpayer.

24        (7) (a)  If a refund or credit is due because the amount of tax deducted and withheld from

25    wages exceeds the actual tax due, [no] a refund or credit may not be made or allowed unless the

26    taxpayer or his legal representative files with the commission a tax return claiming the refund or

27    credit:

28        (i)  within three years from the due date of the return, plus the period of any extension of

29    time for filing the return provided for in Subsection (7)(c); or

30        (ii)  within two years from the date the tax was paid, whichever period is later.

17    issued in cases charging the taxpayer with a felony, a misdemeanor, or an infraction described in

18    this section which are outstanding on or after February 16, 1984.

19        (9)  If the amount allowable as a credit for tax withheld from the taxpayer exceeds the tax

20    to which the credit relates, the excess is considered an overpayment.

21        (10)  A claim for credit or refund of an overpayment which is attributable to the application

22    to the taxpayer of a net operating loss carryback shall be filed within three years from the time the

23    return was due for the taxable year of the loss.

24        (11)  If there has been an overpayment of the tax which is required to be deducted and

25    withheld under Section 59-10-402, a refund shall be made to the employer only to the extent that

26    the amount of overpayment was not deducted and withheld by the employer.

27        (12)  If there is no tax liability for a period in which an amount is paid as income tax, the

28    amount is an overpayment.

29        (13)  If an income tax is assessed or collected after the expiration of the applicable period

30    of limitation, that amount is an overpayment.

31        (14) (a)  If a taxpayer is required to report a change or correction in federal taxable income

4    of tax shall be filed by the taxpayer within two years from the date the notice of the change,

5    correction, or amended return was required to be filed with the commission.

6        (b)  If the report or amended return is not filed within 90 days, interest on any resulting

7    refund or credit ceases to accrue after the 90-day period.

8        (c)  The amount of the credit or refund may not exceed the amount of the reduction in tax

9    attributable to the federal change, correction, or items amended on the taxpayer's amended federal

10    income tax return.

18    provisions of this chapter, a refund or credit shall be made to the employer only to the extent that

19    the amount of the overpayment was not deducted and withheld from wages under the provisions

20    of this chapter.

21        (18)  If a taxpayer who is entitled to a refund under this chapter dies, the commission may

22    make payment to the duly appointed executor or administrator of the taxpayer's estate.  If there is

26    59-10-536(3)(c), credit may be allowed or a refund paid any time before the expiration of the

27    period within which a deficiency may be assessed.
