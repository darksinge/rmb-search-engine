issues during the 2007 interim:
            
684

    
    (a)  whether all voters in the existing district should be involved in the decision to
            
685

    
create a new district, since all portions of an existing school district will be affected by the
            
686

    
creation of a new school district;
            
687

    
    (b)  whether a feasibility study should be required for each district that results from the
            
688

    
creation of a new district rather than just for the new district;
            
689

    
    (c)  whether the issue of school building equalization for the districts that result from
            
690

    
the creation of a new district should be addressed to ensure that growing areas do not carry a
            
691

    
tax burden not shared by those in other areas of the original district and to avoid the possibility
            
692

    
of lawsuits that might arise because of the disparate tax burdens; and
            
693

    
    (d)  whether any existing district should be required to divide into two or more districts
            
694

    
when it reaches a certain size.
            
695

    
    (2)  The Political Subdivisions Interim Committee is authorized to establish a
            
696

    
subcommittee for the purpose of conducting the study under Subsection (1).
