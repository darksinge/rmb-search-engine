Section  
62A-4a-201

 is amended to read:
            
361

    
     62A-4a-201.  Rights of parents -- Children's rights -- Interest and responsibility of
            
362

    
 state.
            
363

    
    (1) (a)  Under both the United States Constitution and the constitution of this state, a
            
364

    
parent possesses a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of the
            
365

    
parent's children.  A fundamentally fair process must be provided to parents if the state moves
            
366

    
to challenge or interfere with parental rights.  A governmental entity must support any actions
            
367

    
or allegations made in opposition to the rights and desires of a parent regarding the parent's
            
368

    
children by sufficient evidence to satisfy a parent's constitutional entitlement to heightened

            
369


    
protection against government interference with the parent's fundamental rights and liberty
            
370

    
interests.
            
371

    
    (b)  The fundamental liberty interest of a parent concerning the care, custody, and
            
372

    
management of the parent's children is recognized, protected, and does not cease to exist
            
373

    
simply because a parent may fail to be a model parent or because the parent's child is placed in
            
374

    
the temporary custody of the state.  At all times, a parent retains a vital interest in preventing
            
375

    
the irretrievable destruction of family life.  Prior to an adjudication of unfitness, government
            
376

    
action in relation to parents and their children may not exceed the least restrictive means or
            
377

    
alternatives available to accomplish a compelling state interest.  Until the state proves parental
            
378

    
unfitness, the child and the child's parents share a vital interest in preventing erroneous
            
379

    
termination of their natural relationship and the state cannot presume that a child and the child's
            
380

    
parents are adversaries.
            
381

    
    (c)  It is in the best interest and welfare of a child to be raised under the care and
            
382

    
supervision of the child's natural parents.  A child's need for a normal family life in a
            
383

    
permanent home, and for positive, nurturing family relationships will usually best be met by
            
384

    
the child's natural parents.  Additionally, the integrity of the family unit, and the right of parents
            
385

    
to conceive and raise their children have found protection in the due process clause of the
            
386

    
Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  The right of a fit, competent parent
            
387

    
to raise the parent's child without undue government interference is a fundamental liberty
            
388

    
interest that has long been protected by the laws and Constitution of this state and of the United
            
389

    
States.
            
390

    
    (d)  The state recognizes that:
            
391

    
    (i)  a parent has the right, obligation, responsibility, and authority to raise, manage,
            
392

    
train, educate, provide for, and reasonably discipline the parent's children; and
            
393

    
    (ii)  the state's role is secondary and supportive to the primary role of a parent.
            
394

    
    [(d)] (e)  It is the public policy of this state that parents retain the fundamental right and
            
395

    
duty to exercise primary control over the care, supervision, upbringing, and education of their
            
396

    
children.
            
397

    
    [(e)] (f)  Subsections (2) through (7) shall be interpreted and applied consistent with
            
398

    
this Subsection (1).
            
399

    
    (2)  It is also the public policy of this state that children have the right to protection

            
400


    
from abuse and neglect, and that the state retains a compelling interest in investigating,
            
401

    
prosecuting, and punishing abuse and neglect, as defined in this chapter, and in Title 78,
            
402

    
Chapter 3a, Juvenile Court Act of 1996.  Therefore, the state, as parens patriae, has an interest
            
403

    
in and responsibility to protect children whose parents abuse them or do not adequately provide
            
404

    
for their welfare.  There may be circumstances where a parent's conduct or condition is a
            
405

    
substantial departure from the norm and the parent is unable or unwilling to render safe and
            
406

    
proper parental care and protection.  Under those circumstances, the state may take action for
            
407

    
the welfare and protection of the parent's children.
            
408

    
    (3)  When the division intervenes on behalf of an abused, neglected, or dependent child,
            
409

    
it shall take into account the child's need for protection from immediate harm.  Throughout its
            
410

    
involvement, the division shall utilize the least intrusive and least restrictive means available to
            
411

    
protect a child, in an effort to ensure that children are brought up in stable, permanent families,
            
412

    
rather than in temporary foster placements under the supervision of the state.
            
413

    
    (4)  When circumstances within the family pose a threat to the child's immediate safety
            
414

    
or welfare, the division may obtain custody of the child for a planned period and place the child
            
415

    
in a safe environment, in accordance with the requirements of Title 78, Chapter 3a, Part 3,
            
416

    
Abuse, Neglect, and Dependency Proceedings.
            
417

    
    (5)  In determining and making "reasonable efforts" with regard to a child, pursuant to
            
418

    
the provisions of Section 

62A-4a-203

, both the division's and the court's paramount concern
            
419

    
shall be the child's health, safety, and welfare.  The desires of a parent for the parent's child
            
420

    
shall be given full and serious consideration by the division and the court.
            
421

    
    (6)  In cases where actual sexual abuse, abandonment, or serious physical abuse or
            
422

    
neglect are established, the state has no duty to make "reasonable efforts" or to, in any other
            
423

    
way, attempt to maintain a child in the child's home, provide reunification services, or to
            
424

    
attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.  This Subsection (6) does not exempt the
            
425

    
division from providing court-ordered services.
            
426

    
    (7) (a)  It is the division's obligation, under federal law, to achieve permanency for
            
427

    
children who are abused, neglected, or dependent.  If the use or continuation of "reasonable
            
428

    
efforts," as described in Subsections (5) and (6), is determined to be inconsistent with the
            
429

    
permanency plan for a child, then measures shall be taken, in a timely manner, to place the
            
430

    
child in accordance with the permanency plan, and to complete whatever steps are necessary to

            
431


    
finalize the permanent placement of the child.
            
432

    
    (b)  If, because of his conduct or condition, a parent is determined to be unfit or
            
433

    
incompetent based on the grounds for termination of parental rights described in Title 78,
            
434

    
Chapter 3a, Part 4, Termination of Parental Rights Act, the welfare and best interest of the
            
435

    
child is of paramount importance, and shall govern in determining whether that parent's rights
            
436

    
should be terminated.
            
437

    
    (8)  The state's right to direct or intervene in the provision of medical or mental health
            
438

    
care for a child is subject to Subsection 

78-3a-118

(2)(n).

    (b)  In determining whether preventive or family preservation services are reasonable
            
451

    
and appropriate, in keeping with the provisions of Subsection 

62A-4a-201

(1) the child's health,
            
452

    
safety, and welfare shall be the paramount concern.

    (c)  The division shall consider whether [those] the services described in Subsection

(2)(n)(iii), upon the sworn testimony of
            
1288

1300

    
    (11)  Service of summons in the state shall be made personally, by delivering a copy to
            
1301

    
the person summoned; provided, however, that parents of a minor living together at their usual
            
1302

    
place of abode may both be served by personal delivery to either parent of copies of the

    (12)  If the judge makes a written finding that he has reason to believe that personal
            
1305

    
service of the summons will be unsuccessful, or will not accomplish notification within a
            
1306

    
reasonable time after issuance of the summons, he may order service by registered mail, with a

1313

    
parent or guardian, provided that due notice has been given in the following manner:
            
1314

    
    (a)  If the address of the parent or guardian is known, due notice is given by sending
            
1315

    
him a copy of the summons by registered mail with a return receipt to be signed by the
            
1316

    
addressee only, or by personal service outside the state, as provided in the Utah Rules of Civil
            
1317

    
Procedure.  Service by registered mail shall be complete upon return to the court of the signed
            
1318

1326

    
the person served was served personally within the state.
            
1327

    
    (14)  In the case of service in the state, service completed not less than 48 hours before
            
1328

    
the time set in the summons for the appearance of the person served, shall be sufficient to
            
1329

    
confer jurisdiction.  In the case of service outside the state, service completed not less than five

            
1330


    
days before the time set in the summons for appearance of the person served, shall be sufficient

1619

    
five judicial days.
            
1620

    
    (b)  A court shall honor, as nearly as practicable, the request by a parent or guardian for
            
1621

    
a continuance under Subsection (8)(a).
            
1622

    
    (9) (a)  If the child is in the protective custody of the division, the court shall order that
            
1623

    
the [minor] child be released from the protective custody of the division unless it finds, by a
            
1624

    
preponderance of the evidence, that any one of the following exist:
            
1625

    
    [(a)] (i)  subject to Subsection (9)(b)(i),  there is a substantial danger to the physical
            
1626

    
health or safety of the minor and the minor's physical health or safety may not be protected
            
1627

    
without removing him from his parent's custody[.  If a minor has previously been adjudicated
            
1628

    
as abused, neglected, or dependent and a subsequent incident of abuse, neglect, or dependency
            
1629

    
occurs, that fact constitutes prima facie evidence that the child cannot safely remain in the
            
1630

    
custody of his parent];
            
1631

    
    [(b)] (ii)  the minor is suffering emotional damage[, as may be indicated by, but is not
            
1632

    
limited to, extreme anxiety, depression, withdrawal, or negative aggressive behavior toward
            
1633

    
self or others,] and there are no reasonable means available by which the minor's emotional
            
1634

    
health may be protected without removing the minor from the custody of his parent;
            
1635

    
    (iii)  there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer abuse or neglect if the child is
            
1636

    
not removed from the custody of the child's parents;
            
1637

    
    [(c)] (iv)  subject to Subsection (9)(b)(ii), the minor or another minor residing in the
            
1638

    
same household has been physically or sexually abused, or is considered to be at substantial
            
1639

    
risk of being physically or sexually abused, by a:

            
1640


    
    (A)  parent[, a];
            
1641

    
    (B)  member of the parent's household[,]; or [other]
            
1642

    
    (C)  person known to the parent[.  If a parent has received actual notice that physical or
            
1643

    
sexual abuse by a person known to the parent has occurred, and there is evidence that the
            
1644

    
parent has allowed the child to be in the physical presence of the alleged abuser, that fact
            
1645

    
constitutes prima facie evidence that the child is at substantial risk of being physically or
            
1646

    
sexually abused];
            
1647

    
    [(d)] (v)  the parent is unwilling to have physical custody of the child;
            
1648

    
    [(e)] (vi)  the minor [has been left] is without any provision for his support;
            
1649

    
    [(f)] (vii)  a parent who [has been] is incarcerated or institutionalized has not or cannot
            
1650

    
arrange for safe and appropriate care for the minor;
            
1651

    
    [(g)] (viii) (A)  a relative or other adult custodian with whom the minor has been left by
            
1652

    
the parent is unwilling or unable to provide care or support for the minor[,];
            
1653

    
    (B)  the whereabouts of the parent are unknown[,]; and
            
1654

    
    (C)  reasonable efforts to locate [him have been] the parent are unsuccessful;
            
1655

    
    [(h)] (ix)  the minor is in [immediate] urgent need of medical care;
            
1656

    
    [(i)] (x)  the physical environment or the fact that the child is left unattended beyond a
            
1657

    
reasonable period of time poses a threat to the child's health or safety;
            
1658

    
    [(j)] (xi)  the minor or another minor residing in the same household has been
            
1659

    
neglected;
            
1660

    
    [(k)] (xii)  the parent, or an adult residing in the same household as the parent, [has
            
1661

    
been] is charged or arrested pursuant to Title 58, Chapter 37d, Clandestine Drug Lab Act, and
            
1662

    
any clandestine laboratory operation, as defined in Section 

58-37d-3

, was located in the
            
1663

    
residence or on the property where the child resided; or
            
1664

    
    [(l)] (xiii)  the child's welfare is [otherwise] substantially endangered.
            
1665

    
    (b) (i)  Prima facie evidence of the finding described in Subsection (9)(a)(i) is
            
1666

    
established if:
            
1667

    
    (A)  a court previously adjudicated that the child suffered abuse, neglect, or dependency
            
1668

    
involving the parent; and
            
1669

    
    (B)  a subsequent incident of abuse, neglect, or dependency involving the parent occurs.
            
1670

    
    (ii)  For purposes of Subsection (9)(a)(iv), if the court finds that the parent knowingly

            
1671


    
allowed the child to be in the physical care of a person after the parent received actual notice
            
1672

    
that the person physically or sexually abused the child, that fact constitutes prima facie
            
1673

    
evidence that there is a substantial risk that the child will be physically or sexually abused.
            
1674

    
    (10) (a)  The court shall also make a determination on the record as to whether
            
1675

    
reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the minor from
            
1676

    
his home and whether there are available services that would prevent the need for continued
            
1677

    
removal.  If the court finds that the minor can be safely returned to the custody of his parent or
            
1678

    
guardian through the provision of those services, it shall place the minor with his parent or
            
1679

    
guardian and order that those services be provided by the division.
            
1680

    
    (b)  In making that determination, and in ordering and providing services, the child's
            
1681

    
health,  safety, and welfare shall be the paramount concern, in accordance with federal law.
            
1682

    
    (11)  Where the division's first contact with the family occurred during an emergency
            
1683

    
situation in which the child could not safely remain at home, the court shall make a finding that
            
1684

    
any lack of preplacement preventive efforts was appropriate.
            
1685

    
    (12)  In cases where actual sexual abuse or abandonment, or serious physical abuse or
            
1686

    
neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make "reasonable
            
1687

    
efforts" or to, in any other way, attempt to maintain a child in his home, return a child to his
            
1688

    
home, provide reunification services, or attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.
            
1689

    
    (13)  The court may not order continued removal of a minor solely on the basis of
            
1690

    
educational neglect as described in Subsection 

78-3a-103

(1)(s)(ii).
            
1691

    
    (14) (a)  Whenever a court orders continued removal of a minor under this section, it
            
1692

    
shall state the facts on which that decision is based.
            
1693

    
    (b)  If no continued removal is ordered and the minor is returned home, the court shall
            
1694

    
state the facts on which that decision is based.
            
1695

    
    (15)  If the court finds that continued removal and temporary custody are necessary for
            
1696

    
the protection of a child because harm may result to the child if he were returned home, it shall
            
1697

    
order continued removal regardless of any error in the initial removal of the child, or the failure
            
1698

    
of a party to comply with notice provisions, or any other procedural requirement of this chapter
            
1699

    
or Title 62A, Chapter 4a, Child and Family Services.
            
1700

    
    Section 21.

    (ii)  public or private entity or agency; or
            
1707

    
    (c)  order:
            
1708

    
    (i)  protective supervision;
            
1709

    
    (ii)  family preservation;

1712

    
    (2) (a) (i)  Whenever the court orders continued removal at the dispositional hearing,
            
1713

    
and that the minor remain in the custody of the division, the court shall first:
            
1714

    
    (A)  establish a primary permanency goal for the minor; and
            
1715

    
    (B)  determine whether, in view of the primary permanency goal, reunification services
            
1716

    
are appropriate for the minor and the minor's family, pursuant to Subsection (3).
            
1717

    
    (ii)  Subject to Subsection (2)(b), if the court determines that reunification services are
            
1718

    
appropriate for the minor and the minor's family, the court shall provide for reasonable
            
1719

    
parent-time with the parent or parents from whose custody the minor was removed, unless
            
1720

    
parent-time is not in the best interest of the minor.
            
1721

    
    (iii) (A)  In cases where obvious sexual abuse, abandonment, or serious physical abuse
            
1722

    
or neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make "reasonable
            
1723

    
efforts" or to, in any other way, attempt to provide reunification services, or to attempt to
            
1724

    
rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.
            
1725

    
    (B)  In all cases, the minor's health, safety, and welfare shall be the court's paramount
            
1726

    
concern in determining whether reasonable efforts to reunify should be made.
            
1727

    
    (b) (i)  For purposes of Subsection (2)(a)(ii), parent-time is in the best interests of a
            
1728

    
minor unless the court makes a finding that it is necessary to deny parent-time in order to:
            
1729

    
    (A)  protect the physical safety of the minor;
            
1730

    
    (B)  protect the life of the minor; or
            
1731

    
    (C)  prevent the minor from being traumatized by contact with the parent due to the
            
1732

    
minor's fear of the parent in light of the nature of the alleged abuse or neglect.

            
1733


    
    (ii)  Notwithstanding Subsection (2)(a)(ii), a court may not deny parent-time based
            
1734

    
solely on a parent's failure to:
            
1735

    
    (A)  prove that the parent has not used legal or illegal substances; or
            
1736

    
    (B)  comply with an aspect of the child and family plan that is ordered by the court.
            
1737

    
    (c) (i)  In addition to the primary permanency goal, the court shall establish a concurrent
            
1738

    
permanency goal that shall include:
            
1739

    
    (A)  a representative list of the conditions under which the primary permanency goal
            
1740

    
will be abandoned in favor of the concurrent permanency goal; and
            
1741

    
    (B)  an explanation of the effect of abandoning or modifying the primary permanency

minor's primary permanency goal.

.

1752

1762

    
    (ii)  The court shall:
            
1763

1765

to be inconsistent with the final permanency plan for the minor established pursuant to
            
1778

    
[Subsection] Section

1789

    
    (iii)  If reunification services are not ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted
            
1790

    
within 30 days, in accordance with Section 

78-3a-312

.
            
1791

    
    (g)  With regard to a minor who is 36 months of age or younger at the time the minor is
            
1792

    
initially removed from the home, the court shall:
            
1793

    
    (i)  hold a permanency hearing eight months after the date of the initial removal,
            
1794

    
pursuant to Section 

78-3a-312

; and

            
1795


    
    (ii)  order the discontinuance of those services after eight months from the initial
            
1796

    
removal of the minor from the home if the parent or parents have not made substantial efforts
            
1797

    
to comply with the child and family plan.
            
1798

    
    (h)  With regard to a minor in the custody of the division whose parent or parents are
            
1799

    
ordered to receive reunification services but who have abandoned that minor for a period of six
            
1800

    
months from the date that reunification services were ordered:
            
1801

    
    (i)  the court shall terminate reunification services; and
            
1802

    
    (ii)  the division shall petition the court for termination of parental rights.
            
1803

    
    (3) (a)  Because of the state's interest in and responsibility to protect and provide
            
1804

    
permanency for minors who are abused, neglected, or dependent, the Legislature finds that a
            
1805

    
parent's interest in receiving reunification services is limited.
            
1806

    
    (b)  The court may determine that:
            
1807

    
    (i)  efforts to reunify a minor with the minor's family are not reasonable or appropriate,
            
1808

    
based on the individual circumstances; and
            
1809

    
    (ii)  reunification services should not be provided.
            
1810

    
    (c)  In determining "reasonable efforts" to be made with respect to a minor, and in
            
1811

    
making "reasonable efforts," the minor's health, safety, and welfare shall be the paramount
            
1812

    
concern.
            
1813

    
    (d) (i)  There is a presumption that reunification services should not be provided to a
            
1814

    
parent if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that any of the following
            
1815

    
circumstances exist:
            
1816

    
    (A)  the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, based upon a verified affidavit
            
1817

    
indicating that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent;
            
1818

    
    (B)  subject to Subsection (3)(d)(ii), the parent is suffering from a mental illness of such
            
1819

    
magnitude that it renders the parent incapable of utilizing reunification services;
            
1820

    
    (C)  the minor was previously adjudicated as an abused child due to physical or sexual
            
1821

    
abuse, and following the adjudication the minor:
            
1822

    
    (I)  was removed from the custody of the minor's parent;
            
1823

    
    (II)  was subsequently returned to the custody of the parent; and
            
1824

    
    (III)  is being removed due to additional physical or sexual abuse;
            
1825

    
    (D)  the parent:

            
1826


    
    (I)  caused the death of another minor through abuse or neglect; or
            
1827

    
    (II)  committed, aided, abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to commit:
            
1828

    
    (Aa)  murder or manslaughter of a child; or
            
1829

    
    (Bb)  child abuse homicide;
            
1830

    
    (E)  the minor suffered severe abuse by the parent or by any person known by the
            
1831

    
parent, if the parent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was abusing the
            
1832

    
minor;
            
1833

    
    (F)  the minor is adjudicated an abused child as a result of severe abuse by the parent,
            
1834

    
and the court finds that it would not benefit the minor to pursue reunification services with the
            
1835

    
offending parent;
            
1836

    
    (G)  the parent's rights are terminated with regard to any other minor;
            
1837

    
    (H)  the minor is removed from the minor's home on at least two previous occasions
            
1838

    
and reunification services were offered or provided to the family at those times;
            
1839

    
    (I)  the parent has abandoned the minor for a period of six months or longer; or
            
1840

    
    (J)  any other circumstance that the court determines should preclude reunification
            
1841

    
efforts or services.
            
1842

    
    (ii)  The finding under Subsection (3)(d)(i)(B) shall be based on competent evidence
            
1843

    
from at least two medical or mental health professionals, who are not associates, establishing
            
1844

    
that, even with the provision of services, the parent is not likely to be capable of adequately
            
1845

    
caring for the minor within 12 months from the day on which the court finding is made.
            
1846

    
    (4)  In determining whether reunification services are appropriate, the court shall take
            
1847

    
into consideration:
            
1848

    
    (a)  failure of the parent to respond to previous services or comply with a previous child
            
1849

    
and family plan;
            
1850

    
    (b)  the fact that the minor was abused while the parent was under the influence of
            
1851

    
drugs or alcohol;
            
1852

    
    (c)  any history of violent behavior directed at the child or an immediate family
            
1853

    
member;
            
1854

    
    (d)  whether a parent continues to live with an individual who abused the minor;
            
1855

    
    (e)  any patterns of the parent's behavior that have exposed the minor to repeated abuse;
            
1856

    
    (f)  testimony by a competent professional that the parent's behavior is unlikely to be

            
1857


    
successful; and
            
1858

    
    (g)  whether the parent has expressed an interest in reunification with the minor.
            
1859

    
    (5) (a)  If reunification services are not ordered pursuant to Subsection (3)(a), and the
            
1860

    
whereabouts of a parent become known within six months of the out-of-home placement of the
            
1861

    
minor, the court may order the division to provide reunification services.
            
1862

    
    (b)  The time limits described in Subsection (2) are not tolled by the parent's absence.
            
1863

    
    (6) (a)  If a parent is incarcerated or institutionalized, the court shall order reasonable
            
1864

    
services unless it determines that those services would be detrimental to the minor. 
            
1865

    
    (b)  In making the determination described in Subsection (6)(a), the court shall
            
1866

    
consider:
            
1867

    
    (i)  the age of the minor;
            
1868

    
    (ii)  the degree of parent-child bonding;
            
1869

    
    (iii)  the length of the sentence;
            
1870

    
    (iv)  the nature of the treatment;
            
1871

    
    (v)  the nature of the crime or illness;
            
1872

    
    (vi)  the degree of detriment to the minor if services are not offered;
            
1873

    
    (vii)  for a minor ten years of age or older, the minor's attitude toward the
            
1874

    
implementation of family reunification services; and
            
1875

    
    (viii)  any other appropriate factors.
            
1876

    
    (c)  Reunification services for an incarcerated parent are subject to the 12-month
            
1877

    
limitation imposed in Subsection (2).
            
1878

    
    (d)  Reunification services for an institutionalized parent are subject to the 12-month
            
1879

    
limitation imposed in Subsection (2), unless the court determines that continued reunification
            
1880

    
services would be in the minor's best interest.
            
1881

    
    (7)  If, pursuant to Subsections (3)(d)(i)(B) through (J), the court does not order
            
1882

    
reunification services, a permanency hearing shall be conducted within 30 days, in accordance
            
1883

    
with Section
