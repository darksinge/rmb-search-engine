631

    
    (i)  a copy of the report; and
            
632

    
    (ii)  an opportunity to challenge the supported finding by the division; and
            
633

    
    (e)  that failure to request an opportunity to challenge the supported finding within 30
            
634

    
days of receiving the notice will result in an unappealable supported finding of child abuse,
            
635

    
neglect, or dependency unless the person can show good cause for why compliance within the
            
636

    
30-day requirement was virtually impossible or unreasonably burdensome.
            
637

have the burden of proving, by [a preponderance of the] clear and convincing evidence, [that
            
644

    
there is a reasonable basis to conclude] that child abuse, neglect, or dependency occurred and
            
645

    
that the alleged perpetrator was substantially responsible for the abuse or neglect that occurred.
            
646

    
    (b)  Any party shall have the right of judicial review of final agency action, in

649

    
receiving notice, fails to challenge a supported finding in accordance with this section, may not

655

    
substantially responsible for the abuse, neglect, or dependency which was also the subject of
            
656

    
the supported finding.
            
657

    
    (b)  An adjudicative proceeding under Subsection (5) may be stayed during the time a

    Section 10.  
Section  
62A-4a-117

 is amended to read:
            
695

    
     62A-4a-117.  Performance monitoring system.
            
696

    
    (1)  As used in this section:
            
697

    
    (a)  "Performance goals" means a target level of performance or an expected level of

707

    
system to the Child Welfare Legislative Oversight Panel for review.
            
708

    
    (4)  The division shall fully implement a performance monitoring system on or before
            
709

    
October 1, 1996.

            
710


    
    (5)  Before January 1 each year the director shall submit a written report describing the
            
711

    
difference between actual performance and performance goals for the prior fiscal year to the

715

    
    (a)  a summary of the division's efforts during the prior fiscal year to implement the

regions that have previously implemented the program has been affected by the program,
            
726

    
including data showing the number of referrals to the division:]
            
727

    
    [(i)  accepted for an investigation;]

    [(iii)  not accepted.]
            
730

    
    Section 11.  
Section  
62A-4a-201

 is amended to read:
            
731

    
     62A-4a-201.  Rights of parents -- Children's rights -- Interest and responsibility of
            
732

    
 state.
            
733

    
    (1) (a) (i)  Courts have recognized a general presumption that it is in the best interest
            
734

    
and welfare of a child to be raised under the care and supervision of [his] the child's natural
            
735

    
parents.  A child's need for a normal family life in a permanent home, and for positive,
            
736

    
nurturing family relationships will usually best be met by [his] the child's natural parents.
            
737

    
    (ii)  Additionally, the integrity of the family unit, and the right of parents to conceive
            
738

    
and raise their children have found protection in the due process clause of the Fourteenth
            
739

    
Amendment to the United States Constitution.  The right of a fit, competent parent to raise
            
740

    
[his] the parent's child has long been protected by the laws and Constitution of this state and of

            
741


    
the United States.
            
742

    
    (b) (i)  The state recognizes that:
            
743

    
    (A)  parents have the right, obligation, responsibility, and authority to manage, train,
            
744

    
educate, provide for, and discipline their children; and
            
745

    
    (B)  the state's role is secondary and supportive to that primary role of the parents.
            
746

    
    [(b)] (ii)  It is the public policy of this state that parents retain the fundamental right and
            
747

    
duty to exercise primary control over the care, supervision, upbringing, and education of their
            
748

    
children who are in their custody[.], including the right to make decisions regarding the
            
749

    
discipline and provision of medical and mental health care to their children.
            
750

    
    (iii)  The state's right to order or intervene in the provision of medical and mental health
            
751

    
care for a minor is limited as provided in Subsection 

78-3a-118

(2)(n).
            
752

    
    (c) (i)  It is the public policy of this state that a parent or guardian has the right to
            
753

    
reasonably discipline a child, which includes the use of physical and emotional discipline. 
            
754

    
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the appropriate exercise of this right is not
            
755

    
grounds for punishment, restriction, disqualification, or surveillance of any kind, including:
            
756

    
    (A)  arrest or criminal liability of any kind;
            
757

    
    (B)  award or change of physical custody of a child;
            
758

    
    (C)  issuance of a protective order;
            
759

    
    (D)  required reporting or investigation by any person; and
            
760

    
    (E)  withholding licensing.
            
761

    
    (ii)  Discipline by a parent is presumed to be reasonable if it does not constitute serious
            
762

    
physical abuse or mental cruelty.  This presumption may only be rebutted by evidence
            
763

    
establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that:
            
764

    
    (A)  a reasonable person acting under the existing circumstances would expect the
            
765

    
discipline to create a substantial risk of physical abuse of, or mental cruelty to, the child;
            
766

    
    (B)  the discipline was not justified under Section 

76-2-401

; or
            
767

    
    (C)  the discipline constitutes the use of unreasonable or unnecessary physical restraint
            
768

    
or force in self-defense or other circumstances:
            
769

    
    (I)  to obtain possession of a weapon or other dangerous object in the possession or
            
770

    
under the control of a child; or
            
771

    
    (II)  to protect the child or another person from physical injury.

            
772


    
    (2) (a)  It is also the public policy of this state that children have the right to protection
            
773

    
from abuse and neglect, and that the state retains a compelling interest in investigating,
            
774

    
prosecuting, and punishing abuse and neglect, as defined in this chapter, and in Title 78,
            
775

    
Chapter 3a.  Therefore, as a counterweight to parental rights, the state[, as parens patriae,] has
            
776

    
an interest in and responsibility to protect children whose parents abuse them or do not
            
777

    
adequately provide for their [welfare] health and safety.
            
778

    
    (b)  There are circumstances where a parent's conduct or condition is a substantial
            
779

    
departure from the norm and the parent is unable or unwilling to render safe and [proper]
            
780

    
adequate parental care and protection.  Under those circumstances, the [welfare] health, safety,
            
781

    
and protection of children is [the] a consideration of [paramount] primary importance.
            
782

    
    (3)  When the division intervenes on behalf of an abused, neglected, or dependent child,
            
783

    
it shall take into account the child's need for protection from immediate serious harm. 
            
784

    
Throughout its involvement, the division shall utilize the least intrusive means available to
            
785

    
protect a child, in an effort to ensure that children are brought up in stable, permanent
            
786

    
families[,] rather than in temporary foster and other placements under the supervision of the
            
787

    
state.
            
788

    
    (4)  When circumstances within the family pose [a] an immediate serious threat to the
            
789

    
child's health or safety [or welfare], the state's interest in the child's welfare is paramount to the
            
790

    
rights of a parent.  The division may obtain custody of the child for a planned period and place
            
791

    
him in a safe environment, in accordance with the requirements of Title 78, Chapter 3a, Part 3,
            
792

    
Abuse, Neglect, and Dependency Proceedings.
            
793

    
    (5)  In determining and making "reasonable efforts" with regard to a child, pursuant to
            
794

    
the provisions of Section 

62A-4a-203

 and in keeping with the presumptions described in
            
795

    
Subsection (1), both the division's and the court's [paramount] primary concern shall be the
            
796

    
child's health[,] and safety[, and welfare].
            
797

    
    (6) (a)  In cases where actual sexual abuse, willful abandonment, [or] serious physical
            
798

    
abuse, or serious neglect are involved, the state has no duty to make "reasonable efforts" or to,
            
799

    
in any other way, attempt to maintain a child in [his] the child's home, provide reunification
            
800

    
services, or to attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.  [This]
            
801

    
    (b)  Subsection (6)(a) does not exempt the division from providing court-ordered
            
802

    
services.

            
803


    
    (7) (a)  It is the division's obligation, under federal law, to achieve permanency for
            
804

    
children who are abused, neglected, or dependent.  If the use or continuation of "reasonable
            
805

    
efforts," as described in Subsections (5) and (6), is determined to be inconsistent with the
            
806

    
permanency plan for a child, then measures shall be taken, in a timely manner, to place the
            
807

    
child in accordance with the permanency plan, and to complete whatever steps are necessary to
            
808

    
finalize the permanent placement of the child.
            
809

    
    (b)  If, because of [his] a parent's conduct or condition, [a] the parent is determined to
            
810

    
be unfit or incompetent based on the grounds for termination of parental rights described in
            
811

    
Title 78, Chapter 3a, Part 4, Termination of Parental Rights Act, the [welfare] health, safety,
            
812

    
and best interest of the child is of paramount importance, and shall govern in determining
            
813

    
whether that parent's rights should be terminated.
            
814

    
    Section 12.  
Section  
62A-4a-202

 is amended to read:
            
815

    
     62A-4a-202.  Preventive services -- Family preservation services.
            
816

    
    (1) (a)  Within appropriations from the Legislature, the division shall provide
            
817

    
preventive, in-home services and family preservation services for families whose children are
            
818

    
at immediate risk of being removed from the home and for families in crisis, if the child's
            
819

    
[welfare] health or safety is not immediately endangered and the division determines that it is
            
820

    
possible and appropriate.
            
821

    
    (b)  In determining whether preventive or family preservation services are reasonable
            
822

    
and appropriate, in keeping with the provisions of Subsection 

62A-4a-201

(1) the child's
            
823

    
health[,] and safety[, and welfare] shall be the [paramount] primary concern.  The division shall
            
824

    
consider whether those services will be effective within a six-month period[,] and whether they
            
825

    
are likely to prevent reabuse or continued neglect of the child.
            
826

    
    (2)  The division shall maintain a statewide inventory of early intervention, preventive,
            
827

    
and family preservation services available through public and private agencies or individuals
            
828

    
for use by caseworkers. The inventory shall include:
            
829

    
    (a)  the method of accessing each service;
            
830

    
    (b)  eligibility requirements for each service; [and]
            
831

    
    (c)  the geographic areas and the number of families that can be served by each
            
832

    
service[,]; and
            
833

    
    (d)  information regarding waiting lists for each service.

            
834


    
    (3)  As a part of its preventive services, the division shall provide family preservation
            
835

    
services that are short-term, intensive, crisis intervention programs[, and] that address:
            
836

    (1)  Because removal of a child from [his] the child's home may affect protected,

            
958


    
constitutional rights of the parent, the division shall:
            
959

    
    (a)  when possible and appropriate, without danger to the child's [welfare] health and
            
960

    
safety, make reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of a child from
            
961

    
[his] the child's home prior to placement in substitute care;
            
962

    
    (b)  determine whether there is substantial cause to believe that a child has been or is in

danger of abuse or neglect, in accordance with the guidelines described in Title 78, Chapter 3a,
            
964

    
Part 3, Abuse, Neglect, and Dependency Proceedings, prior to removing the child from [his]
            
965

    
the child's home; and

    (c)  when it is possible and appropriate, and in accordance with the limitations and
            
967

    
requirements of Sections 

78-3a-311

 and 

78-3a-312

968

969

    
    (2)  In determining the reasonableness of efforts needed to maintain a child in [his] the

971

    
or (c), the child's health[,] and safety[, and welfare] shall be the [paramount] primary concern. 
            
972

    
Additionally, the division shall consider whether those services would be effective within a
            
973

    
six-month period, and whether they would be likely to prevent reabuse or continued neglect of
            
974

    
the child.
            
975

    
    (3)  When removal and placement in substitute care is necessary to protect a child, the

    (4)  In cases where obvious sexual abuse, abandonment, [or] serious physical abuse, or
            
979

    
serious neglect are involved, the state has no duty to make "reasonable efforts" or to, in any

    (i)  if residential treatment, rather than a foster home, is the proposed placement, a
            
1043

    
specialized assessment of the child's health needs shall be conducted, including an assessment
            
1044

    
of mental illness and behavior and conduct disorders; and
            
1045

    
    (ii)  parents retain the right to seek separate medical and mental health diagnoses from

1047

    
    [(7)] (9) (a) Each treatment plan shall be specific to each child and the child's family,
            
1048

    
rather than general.  The division shall train its workers to develop treatment plans that comply
            
1049

    
with federal mandates and the specific needs of the particular child and the child's family.
            
1050

    
    (b) All treatment plans and expectations shall be individualized and contain specific

            
1051


    
time frames.
            
1052

    
    (c) Treatment plans shall address problems that keep children in placement and keep
            
1053

    
them from achieving permanence in their lives[.], but shall be limited:
            
1054

    
    (i)  to addressing findings made by the court; and

1059

    
shall be kept informed of and supported to participate in important meetings and procedures
            
1060

    
related to the child's placement.

    [(8)] (10)  With regard to a child who is three years of age or younger, if the goal is not
            
1062

    
to return the child home, the permanency plan for that child shall be adoption.  However, if the
            
1063

    
division documents to the court that there is a compelling reason that adoption, reunification,
            
1064

    
guardianship, and kinship placement are not in the child's best interest, the court may order
            
1065

    
another planned permanent living arrangement in accordance with federal law.

1068

    
 process.
            
1069

    
    (1) (a)  The Legislature finds that, except with regard to a child's natural parent or legal
            
1070

    
guardian, a foster family has a very limited but recognized interest in its familial relationship
            
1071

    
with a foster child who has been in the care and custody of that family.  In making
            
1072

    
determinations regarding removal of a child from a foster home, the division may not dismiss
            
1073

    
the foster family as a mere collection of unrelated individuals.
            
1074

    
    (b)  The Legislature finds that children in the temporary custody and custody of the
            
1075

    
division are experiencing multiple changes in foster care placements with little or no
            
1076

    
documentation, and that numerous studies of child growth and development emphasize the
            
1077

    
importance of stability in foster care living arrangements.
            
1078

    
    (c)  For the reasons described in Subsections (1)(a) and (b), the division shall provide
            
1079

    
procedural due process for a foster family prior to removal of a foster child from their home,
            
1080

    
regardless of the length of time the child has been in that home, unless removal is for the
            
1081

    
purpose of:

            
1082


    
    (i)  returning the child to the child's natural parent or legal guardian;
            
1083

    
    (ii)  immediately placing the child in an approved adoptive home;
            
1084

    
    (iii)  placing the child with a relative, as defined in Subsection 

78-3a-307

(5)(d), who
            
1085

    
obtained custody or asserted an interest in the child within the preference period described in
            
1086

    
Subsection 

78-3a-307

(8); or
            
1087

    
    (iv)  placing an Indian child in accordance with preplacement preferences and other
            
1088

1089

    
    (2) (a) The division shall maintain and utilize due process procedures for removal of a

63, Chapter 46b, Administrative Procedures Act.
            
1092

    
    (b)  Those procedures shall include requirements for:
            
1093

    
    (i)  personal communication with and explanation to foster parents prior to removal of
            
1094

    
the child; and
            
1095

    
    (ii)  an opportunity for foster parents to present their information and concerns to the
            
1096

    
division and to request a review by a third party neutral fact finder prior to removal of the
            
1097

    
child.
            
1098

    
    (c)  If the division determines that there is a reasonable basis to believe that the child is
            
1099

    
in danger or that there is a substantial threat of danger to the health or [welfare] physical safety
            
1100

    
of the child, it shall place the child in emergency foster care during the pendency of the

1102

    
    (3) If the division removes a child from a foster home based upon the child's statement
            
1103

1104

    
division may take no formal action with regard to that foster parent's license until after those
            
1105

    
processes, in addition to any other procedure or hearing required by law, have been completed.
            
1106

    
    (4)  When a complaint is made to the division by a foster child against a foster parent,
            
1107

    
the division shall, within 30 business days, provide the foster parent with information
            
1108

    
regarding:
            
1109

    
    (a)  the specific nature of the complaint[,];

    (b)  the time and place of the alleged incident[,]; and
            
1111

    
    (c)  who was alleged to have been involved.
            
1112

    
    (5)  Whenever the division places a child in a foster home, it shall provide the foster

            
1113


    
parents with:
            
1114

    
    (a)  notification of the requirements of this section;

1119

    
months or longer, in accordance with the limitations and requirements of Section 

78-3a-315

.
            
1120

    
    (6)  The requirements of this section do not apply to the removal of a child based on a
            
1121

    
foster parent's request for that removal.

    (c)  the need, if any, for continued shelter;

    (7)  The court shall consider all relevant evidence provided by persons or entities
            
2876

2877

    
    (8) (a)  If necessary to protect the child, preserve the rights of a party, or for other good
            
2878

    
cause shown, the court may grant no more than one time-limited continuance, not to exceed

    (b)  If the child's parent or guardian requests a continuance under Subsection (8)(a), the
            
2881

    
court shall honor the request as nearly as practicable.
            
2882

    
    (9) (a)  For purposes of this Subsection (9), "serious abuse" means a serious type of
            
2883

    
abuse or neglect described in Subsection 

62A-4a-116.1

(2).
            
2884

    
    [(9)] (b)  If the child is in the protective custody of the division, the court shall order
            
2885

    
that the minor be released from the protective custody of the division unless it [finds, by a
            
2886

    
preponderance of the evidence] can be established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that any one of
            
2887

    
the following exist:
            
2888

    
    [(a)  there is a substantial danger to the physical health or safety of the minor and the
            
2889

    
minor's physical health or safety may not be protected without removing him from his parent's
            
2890

    
custody.  If a minor has previously been adjudicated as abused, neglected, or dependent and a
            
2891

    
subsequent incident of abuse, neglect, or dependency occurs, that fact constitutes prima facie
            
2892

    
evidence that the child cannot safely remain in the custody of his parent;]
            
2893

    
    [(b)  the minor is suffering emotional damage, as may be indicated by, but is not limited
            
2894

    
to, extreme anxiety, depression, withdrawal, or negative aggressive behavior toward self or
            
2895

    
others, and there are no reasonable means available by which the minor's emotional health may
            
2896

    
be protected without removing the minor from the custody of his parent;]
            
2897

    
    (i)  without continued custody the child is at immediate substantial risk of serious
            
2898

    
abuse; 
            
2899

    
    [(c)] (ii)  the minor or another minor residing in the same household has been
            
2900

    
[physically or sexually abused] the subject of serious abuse, or is considered to be at substantial
            
2901

    
imminent risk of [being physically or sexually abused] serious abuse, by a parent, a member of
            
2902

    
the parent's household, or other person known to the parent[.  If a parent has received actual
            
2903

    
notice that physical or sexual abuse by a person known to the parent has occurred, and there is
            
2904

    
evidence that the parent has allowed the child to be in the physical presence of the alleged
            
2905

    
abuser, that fact constitutes prima facie evidence that the child is at substantial risk of being
            
2906

    
physically or sexually abused];
            
2907

    
    [(d)] (iii)  the parent is unwilling to have physical custody of the child;
            
2908

    
    [(e)] (iv)  the minor has been left without any provision for [his] the minor's support;
            
2909

    
    [(f)] (v)  a parent who has been incarcerated or institutionalized has not or cannot
            
2910

    
arrange for safe and appropriate care for the minor;

            
2911


    
    [(g)] (vi)  a relative or other adult custodian with whom the minor has been left by the
            
2912

    
parent is unwilling or unable to provide care or support for the minor, the whereabouts of the
            
2913

    
parent are unknown, and reasonable efforts to locate [him] the parent have been unsuccessful;
            
2914

    
or
            
2915

    
    [(h)  the minor is in immediate need of medical care;]
            
2916

    
    [(i)  the physical environment or the fact that the child is left unattended poses a threat
            
2917

    
to the child's health or safety;]
            
2918

    
    [(j)  the minor or another minor residing in the same household has been neglected;]
            
2919

    
    [(k)] (vii)  the parent, or an adult residing in the same household as the parent, has been
            
2920

    
charged or arrested pursuant to Title 58, Chapter 37d, Clandestine Drug Lab Act, and any
            
2921

    
clandestine laboratory operation, as defined in Section 

58-37d-3

, was located in the residence
            
2922

    
or on the property where the child resided[; or].
            
2923

    
    [(l)  the child's welfare is otherwise endangered.]
            
2924

    
    (c) (i)  For purposes of Subsection (9)(b)(i), if a minor has previously been adjudicated
            
2925

    
as abused, neglected, or dependent and a subsequent incident of abuse or dependency occurs,
            
2926

    
that fact constitutes prima facie evidence that the child cannot safely remain in the custody of
            
2927

    
the minor's parent.
            
2928

    
    (ii)  For purposes of Subsection (9)(b)(ii), strong evidence exists that the child is at
            
2929

    
substantial imminent risk of serious abuse if:
            
2930

    
    (A)  the parent has received actual notice that serious abuse by a person known to the
            
2931

    
parent has occurred; and
            
2932

    
    (B)  there is clear and convincing evidence that the parent has allowed the child to be in
            
2933

    
the physical presence of the alleged abuser;
            
2934

    
    (10) (a)  The court shall also make a determination on the record as to whether
            
2935

    
reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the minor from
            
2936

    
[his] the minor's home and whether there are available services that would prevent the need for
            
2937

    
continued removal.  If the court finds that the minor can be safely returned to the custody of
            
2938

    
[his] the minor's parent or guardian through the provision of those services, it shall place the
            
2939

    
minor with [his] the minor's parent or guardian and order that those services be provided by the
            
2940

    
division.
            
2941

    
    (b)  In making that determination, and in ordering and providing services, the child's

            
2942


    
health[,] and safety[, and welfare] shall be the [paramount] primary concern, in accordance
            
2943

    
with federal law.
            
2944

    
    (11)  Where the division's first contact with the family occurred during an emergency
            
2945

    
situation in which the child could not safely remain at home, the court shall make a finding that
            
2946

    
any lack of preplacement preventive efforts was appropriate.
            
2947

    
    (12)  In cases where actual sexual abuse or abandonment, or serious physical abuse or
            
2948

    
neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make "reasonable
            
2949

    
efforts" or to, in any other way, attempt to maintain a child in [his] the child's home, return a
            
2950

    
child to [his] the child's home, provide reunification services, or attempt to rehabilitate the
            
2951

    
offending parent or parents.
            
2952

    
    (13)  The court may not order continued removal of a minor solely on the basis of
            
2953

    
educational neglect [as described in Subsection 

78-3a-103

(1)(s)(ii)].
            
2954

    
    (14) (a)  Whenever a court orders continued removal of a minor under this section, it
            
2955

    
shall state the facts on which that decision is based.
            
2956

    
    (b)  If no continued removal is ordered and the minor is returned home, the court shall
            
2957

    
state the facts on which that decision is based.
            
2958

    
    (15)  If the court finds that continued removal and temporary custody are necessary for
            
2959

    
the protection of a child [because harm may result to the child if he were returned home], it
            
2960

    
shall order continued removal regardless of any error in the initial removal of the child, or the
            
2961

    
failure of a party to comply with notice provisions, or any other procedural requirement of this
            
2962

    
chapter or Title 62A, Chapter 4a, Child and Family Services.
            
2963

    
    Section 42.  
Section  
78-3a-311

 is amended to read:
            
2964

    
     78-3a-311.  Dispositional hearing -- Reunification services -- Exceptions.
            
2965

    
    (1)  The court may make any of the dispositions described in Section 

78-3a-118

, place
            
2966

    
the child in the custody or guardianship of any individual or public or private entity or agency,
            
2967

    
or order protective supervision, family preservation, medical or mental health treatment, or
            
2968

    
other services.
            
2969

    
    (2) (a) (i) Whenever the court orders continued removal at the dispositional hearing,
            
2970

    
and that the minor remain in the custody of the division [of Child and Family Services], it shall
            
2971

    
first establish a primary permanency goal for the minor and determine whether, in view of the
            
2972

    
primary permanency goal, reunification services are appropriate for the child and the child's

            
2973


    
family, pursuant to Subsection (3).
            
2974

    
    (ii)  When the court determines that reunification services are appropriate for the child
            
2975

    
and the child's family, the court shall provide for reasonable parent-time with the parent or
            
2976

    
parents from whose custody the child was removed, unless:
            
2977

    
    (A)  parent-time [is not in the best interest] would threaten the physical safety or life of
            
2978

    
the child[.];
            
2979

    
    (B)  the child suffered at the hands of the parent:
            
2980

    
    (I)  sexual abuse or sexual exploitation; or
            
2981

    
    (II)  serious physical abuse or mental cruelty, and parent-time would cause the child
            
2982

    
serious emotional anguish.
            
2983

    
    (iii)  In cases where obvious sexual abuse, abandonment, or serious physical abuse or
            
2984

    
serious neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make
            
2985

    
"reasonable efforts" or to, in any other way, attempt to provide reunification services, or to
            
2986

    
attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.  In all cases, the child's health[,] and
            
2987

    
safety[, and welfare] shall be the court's [paramount] primary concern in determining whether
            
2988

    
reasonable efforts to reunify should be made.
            
2989

    
    (b) (i)  In addition to the primary permanency goal, the court shall establish a
            
2990

    
concurrent permanency goal.  The concurrent permanency goal shall include a representative
            
2991

    
list of the conditions under which the primary permanency goal will be abandoned in favor of
            
2992

    
the concurrent permanency goal and an explanation of the effect of abandoning or modifying
            
2993

    
the primary permanency goal.
            
2994

    
    (ii)  A permanency hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Subsection
            
2995

    

78-3a-312

(1)(b) within 30 days if something other than reunification is initially established as a
            
2996

    
child's primary permanency goal.
            
2997

    
    (iii) (A)  The court may amend a child's primary permanency goal before the
            
2998

    
establishment of a final permanency plan under Section 

78-3a-312

.  The court is not limited to
            
2999

    
the terms of the concurrent permanency goal in the event that the primary permanency goal is
            
3000

    
abandoned.
            
3001

    
    (B)  If, at anytime, the court determines that reunification is no longer a child's primary
            
3002

    
permanency goal, the court shall conduct a permanency hearing in accordance with Section
            
3003

    

78-3a-312

 within the earlier of 30 days of the court's determination or 12 months from the

            
3004


    
original removal of the child.
            
3005

    
    (c) (i)  If the court determines that reunification services are appropriate, it shall order
            
3006

    
that the division make reasonable efforts to provide services to the child and the child's parent
            
3007

    
for the purpose of facilitating reunification of the family, for a specified period of time. In
            
3008

    
providing those services, the child's health[,] and safety[, and welfare] shall be the division's
            
3009

    
[paramount] primary concern, and the court shall so order.
            
3010

    
    (ii)  The court shall determine whether the services offered or provided by the division
            
3011

    
under the treatment plan constitute "reasonable efforts" on the part of the division.  The court
            
3012

    
shall also determine and define the responsibilities of the parent under the treatment plan. 
            
3013

    
Those duties and responsibilities shall be identified on the record, for the purpose of assisting
            
3014

    
in any future determination regarding the provision of reasonable efforts, in accordance with
            
3015

    
state and federal law.
            
3016

    
    (iii)  The time period for reunification services may not exceed 12 months from the date
            
3017

    
that the child was initially removed from the child's home.  Nothing in this section may be
            
3018

    
construed to entitle any parent to an entire 12 months of reunification services.
            
3019

    
    (iv)  If reunification services have been ordered, the court may terminate those services
            
3020

    
at any time.
            
3021

    
    (v)  If, at any time, continuation of reasonable efforts to reunify a child is determined to
            
3022

    
be inconsistent with the final permanency plan for the child established pursuant to Subsection
            
3023

    

78-3a-312

, then measures shall be taken, in a timely manner, to place the child in accordance
            
3024

    
with the permanency plan, and to complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the
            
3025

    
permanent placement of the child.
            
3026

    
    (d)  Any physical custody of the minor by the parent or a relative during the period
            
3027

    
described in Subsection (2)(c) does not interrupt the running of the period.
            
3028

    
    (e) (i)  If reunification services have been ordered, a permanency hearing shall be
            
3029

    
conducted by the court in accordance with Section 

78-3a-312

 at the expiration of the time
            
3030

    
period for reunification services.  The permanency hearing shall be held no later than 12
            
3031

    
months after the original removal of the child.
            
3032

    
    (ii)  If reunification services have not been ordered, a permanency hearing shall be

    (f)  With regard to a child who is 36 months of age or younger at the time the child is

            
3035


    
initially removed from the home, the court shall:
            
3036

    
    (i)  hold a permanency hearing eight months after the date of the initial removal,
            
3037

    
pursuant to Section 

78-3a-312

; and
            
3038

    
    (ii)  order the discontinuance of those services after eight months from the initial
            
3039

    
removal of the child from the home if the parent or parents have not made substantial efforts to
            
3040

    
comply with the treatment plan.
            
3041

    
    (g)  With regard to a child in the custody of the division whose parent or parents have
            
3042

    
been ordered to receive reunification services but who have abandoned that child for a period
            
3043

    
of six months since the date that reunification services were ordered, the court shall terminate
            
3044

    
reunification services, and the division shall petition the court for termination of parental
            
3045

    
rights.
            
3046

    
    (3) (a)  Because of the state's interest in and responsibility to protect and provide
            
3047

    
permanency for children who are abused, neglected, or dependent, the Legislature finds that a
            
3048

    
parent's interest in receiving reunification services is limited.  The court may determine that
            
3049

    
efforts to reunify a child with the child's family are not reasonable or appropriate, based on the
            
3050

    
individual circumstances, and that reunification services should not be provided.  In
            
3051

    
determining "reasonable efforts" to be made with respect to a child, and in making "reasonable
            
3052

    
efforts," the child's health[,] and safety[, and welfare] shall be the [paramount] primary
            
3053

    
concern.
            
3054

    
    (b)  There is a presumption that reunification services should not be provided to a
            
3055

    
parent if the court finds[, by clear and convincing] evidence that establishes beyond a
            
3056

    
reasonable doubt, that any of the following circumstances exist:
            
3057

    
    (i)  the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, based upon a verified affidavit
            
3058

    
indicating that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent;
            
3059

    
    (ii)  the parent is suffering from a mental [illness] incapacity of such magnitude that it
            
3060

    
renders [him] the parent incapable of utilizing reunification services; that finding shall be based
            
3061

    
on competent evidence from at least two mental health or medical professionals, who are not
            
3062

    
associates, establishing that, even with the provision of services, the parent [is unlikely to be
            
3063

    
capable] will be incapable of adequately caring for the child within 12 months;
            
3064

    
    (iii)  the minor has been previously adjudicated as an abused child due to physical or
            
3065

    
sexual abuse, that following the adjudication the [child] minor was removed from the custody

            
3066


    
of [his] the minor's parent, was subsequently returned to the custody of that parent, and the
            
3067

    
minor is being removed due to additional physical or sexual abuse;
            
3068

    
    (iv)  the parent has caused the death of another child through abuse or neglect or has
            
3069

    
committed, aided, abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to commit murder or
            
3070

    
manslaughter of a child or child abuse homicide;
            
3071

    
    (v)  the minor has suffered [severe] serious abuse by the parent or by any person known
            
3072

    
by the parent, if the parent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was abusing
            
3073

    
the minor;
            
3074

    
    (vi)  the minor has been adjudicated an abused child as a result of [severe] serious abuse
            
3075

    
by the parent, and the court finds that it would not benefit the child to pursue reunification
            
3076

    
services with the offending parent;
            
3077

    
    (vii)  the parent's rights have been terminated with regard to any other child;
            
3078

    
    (viii)  the child has been removed from [his] the child's home on at least two previous
            
3079

    
occasions and reunification services were offered or provided to the family at those times; or
            
3080

    
    (ix)  the parent has abandoned the child for a period of six months or longer[; or].
            
3081

    
    [(x)  any other circumstance that the court determines should preclude reunification
            
3082

    
efforts or services.]
            
3083

    
    (4) (a)  Failure of the parent to [respond to previous services or] comply with [any]
            
3084

    
essential components of a previous treatment plan, the fact that the child was abused while the
            
3085

    
parent was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, a past history of violent behavior directed at
            
3086

    
the child, whether a parent continues to live with an individual who seriously abused the child,
            
3087

    
or any patterns of the parent's behavior that have exposed the child to repeated serious abuse[,
            
3088

    
or testimony by a competent professional that the parent's behavior is unlikely to be
            
3089

    
successful,] shall be considered in determining whether reunification services are appropriate.
            
3090

    
    (b)  The court shall also consider whether the parent has expressed an interest in
            
3091

    
reunification with the child, in determining whether reunification services are appropriate.
            
3092

    
    (5)  If reunification services are not ordered pursuant to Subsection (3)(a), and the
            
3093

    
whereabouts of a parent become known within six months of the out-of-home placement of the
            
3094

    
minor, the court may order the division to provide reunification services.  The time limits
            
3095

    
described in Subsection (2), however, are not tolled by the parent's absence.
            
3096

    
    (6) (a)  If a parent is incarcerated or institutionalized, the court shall order reasonable

            
3097


    
services unless it determines that those services would be seriously detrimental to the health or
            
3098

    
safety of the minor.  In determining detriment, the court shall consider:
            
3099

    
    (i)  the age of the child[,];
            
3100

    
    (ii)  the degree of parent-child bonding[,];
            
3101

    
    (iii)  the length of the sentence[,];
            
3102

    
    (iv)  the nature of the treatment[,];
            
3103

    
    (v)  the nature of the crime or [illness,] mental incapacity;
            
3104

    
    (vi)  the degree of detriment to the [child] child's health and safety if services are not
            
3105

    
offered [and,];
            
3106

    
    (vii)  for minors ten years of age or older, the minor's attitude toward the
            
3107

    
implementation of family reunification services[, and], which shall be given particular
            
3108

    
consideration and weight; and
            
3109

    
    (viii)  any other appropriate factors.
            
3110

    
    (b) (i)  Reunification services for an incarcerated parent are subject to the 12-month
            
3111

    
limitation imposed in Subsection (2).
            
3112

    
    (ii)  Reunification services for an institutionalized parent are subject to the 12-month
            
3113

    
limitation imposed in Subsection (2), unless the court determines that continued reunification
            
3114

    
services would be in the child's best interest.
            
3115

    
    (7)  If, pursuant to Subsection (3)(b)[(ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii), (viii), (ix), or (x)], the
            
3116

    
court does not order reunification services, a permanency hearing shall be conducted within 30

3124

    
    (b)  have failed to maintain physical custody, and have failed to exhibit the normal

3306

    
date on which the child was placed or the plan was commenced, whichever occurs later, that

alone a negligent or unfit parent.
            
3321

    
    Section 49.  
Section  
78-3a-414

 is amended to read:
            
3322

    
     78-3a-414.  Voluntary relinquishment -- Irrevocable.
            
3323

    
    (1)  Voluntary relinquishment or consent for termination of parental rights shall be
            
3324

    
signed or confirmed under oath either:
            
3325

    
    (a)  before a judge of any court that has jurisdiction over proceedings for termination of
            
3326

    
parental rights in this state or any other state, or a public officer appointed by that court for the
            
3327

    
purpose of taking consents or relinquishments; or
            
3328

    
    (b)  except as provided in Subsection (2), any person authorized to take consents or
            
3329

    
relinquishments under Subsections 

78-30-4.18

(1) and (2).
            
3330

    
    (2)  Only the juvenile court is authorized to take consents or relinquishments from a
            
3331

    
parent who has any child who is in the custody of a state agency or who has a child who is
            
3332

    
otherwise under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.
            
3333

    
    (3)  The court, appointed officer, or other authorized person shall certify to the best of
            
3334

    
that person's information and belief that the person executing the consent or relinquishment has
            
3335

    
read and understands the consent or relinquishment and has signed it freely and voluntarily.
            
3336

    
    (4)  A voluntary relinquishment or consent for termination of parental rights is effective

    (5)  The requirements and processes described in Sections 

78-3a-402

 through 

78-3a-410


            
3339

    
do not apply to a voluntary relinquishment or consent for termination of parental rights.  The
            
3340

    
court need only find that the relinquishment or termination is in the child's best interest.
            
3341

    
    (6)  There is a presumption that voluntary relinquishment or consent for termination of
            
3342

    
parental rights is not in the child's best interest where it appears to the court that the primary
            
3343

    
purpose is to avoid a financial support obligation. The presumption may be rebutted, however,
            
3344

    
if the court finds the relinquishment or consent to termination of parental rights will facilitate

            
3345


    
the establishment of stability and permanency for the child.
            
3346

    
    (7)  Upon granting a voluntary relinquishment the court may make orders relating to the
            
3347

    
child's care, health, and [welfare] safety that the court considers to be in the child's best interest.
