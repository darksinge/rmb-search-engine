Section  .  Section   A   a     is amended to read                A   a    . Determination of weighted pupil units.             The number of weighted pupil units in the minimum school program for each year is        the total of the units for each school district determined as follows                   The number of units is computed by adding the average daily membership of all        pupils of the district attending schools, other than kindergarten and self contained classes for        children with a disability.                  The number of units is computed by adding the average daily membership of all        pupils of the school district enrolled in kindergarten and multiplying the total by .  .              a   In those school districts that do not  elect to  hold kindergarten for a full        nine month term, the local school board or charter school governing board may approve a        shorter term of nine weeks  duration.              b   Upon local school board approval, the number of pupils in average daily        membership at the short term kindergarten shall be counted for the purpose of determining the        number of units allowed in the same ratio as the number of days the short term kindergarten is        held, not exceeding nine weeks, compared to the total number of days schools are held in that        school district in the regular school year.                  a   The State Board of Education shall use prior year plus growth to determine        average daily membership in distributing money under the minimum school program where the        distribution is based on kindergarten through grade    ADMs or weighted pupil units.              b   Under prior year plus growth, kindergarten through grade    average daily        membership for the current year is based on the actual kindergarten through grade    average        daily membership for the previous year plus an estimated percentage growth factor.              c   The growth factor is the percentage increase in total average daily membership on        the first school day of October in the current year as compared to the total average daily        membership on the first school day of October of the previous year.

levy is not a reconsideration of the        existing authority unless the proposition submitted to the electors expressly so states.              b   A majority vote opposing a modification does not deprive the  district  local school        board of authority to continue the levy.              c   If adoption of a voted local levy is contingent upon an offset reducing other local        school board levies, the local school board  must  shall allow the electors, in an election, to        consider modifying or discontinuing the imposition of the levy prior to a subsequent increase in        other levies that would increase the total local school board levy.              d   Nothing contained in this section terminates, without an election, the authority of a         school district
