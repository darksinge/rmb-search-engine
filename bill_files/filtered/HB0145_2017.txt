The court may               a   make any of the dispositions described in Section   A                     b   place the minor in the custody or guardianship of any               i   individual  or              ii   public or private entity or agency  or              c   order               i   protective supervision               ii   family preservation               iii   subject to Subsections      b ,   A           d , and   A          n  and        Section   A      . , medical or mental health treatment   or               iv   sibling visitation  or               iv    v   other services.                  Whenever the court orders continued removal at the dispositional hearing, and that        the minor remain in the custody of the division, the court shall first               a   establish a primary permanency plan for the minor  and              b   determine whether, in view of the primary permanency plan, reunification services        are appropriate for the minor and the minor s family, pursuant to Subsections                    through            .                  Subject to Subsections     and    , if the court determines that reunification        services are appropriate for the minor and the minor s family, the court shall provide for        reasonable parent time with the parent or parents from whose custody the minor was removed,        unless parent time is not in the best interest of the minor.                  In cases where obvious sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abandonment, severe        abuse, or severe neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make         reasonable efforts  or to, in any other way, attempt to provide reunification services, or to        attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.                  In all cases, the minor s health, safety, and welfare shall be the court s paramount        concern in determining whether reasonable efforts to reunify should be made.                  For purposes of Subsection    , parent time is in the best interests of a minor unless        the court makes a finding that it is necessary to deny parent time in order to               a   protect the physical safety of the minor               b   protect the life of the minor  or              c   prevent the minor from being traumatized by contact with the parent due to the        minor s fear of the parent in light of the nature of the alleged abuse or neglect.                  Notwithstanding Subsection    , a court may not deny parent time based solely on a        parent s failure to               a   prove that the parent has not used legal or illegal substances  or              b   comply with an aspect of the child and family plan that is ordered by the court.                  a   In addition to the primary permanency plan, the court shall establish a        concurrent permanency plan that shall include               i   a representative list of the conditions under which the primary permanency plan will        be abandoned in favor of the concurrent permanency plan  and              ii   an explanation of the effect of abandoning or modifying the primary permanency        plan.              b   In determining the primary permanency plan and concurrent permanency plan, the        court shall consider               i   the preference for kinship placement over nonkinship placement               ii   the potential for a guardianship placement if the parent child relationship is legally        terminated and no appropriate adoption placement is available  and              iii   the use of an individualized permanency plan, only as a last resort.                  A permanency hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Subsection          A          b  within    days after the day on which the dispositional hearing ends if        something other than reunification is initially established as a minor s primary permanency        plan.                   a   The court may amend a minor s primary permanency plan before the        establishment of a final permanency plan under Section   A      .              b   The court is not limited to the terms of the concurrent permanency plan in the event        that the primary permanency plan is abandoned.              c   If, at any time, the court determines that reunification is no longer a minor s primary        permanency plan, the court shall conduct a permanency hearing in accordance with Section          A       on or before the earlier of               i      days after the day on which the court makes the determination described in this        Subsection      c   or              ii   the day on which the provision of reunification services, described in Section          A      , ends.                   a   If the court determines that reunification services are appropriate, it shall order        that the division make reasonable efforts to provide services to the minor and the minor s        parent for the purpose of facilitating reunification of the family, for a specified period of time.              b   In providing the services described in Subsection      a , the minor s health, safety,        and welfare shall be the division s paramount concern, and the court shall so order.                   a   The court shall               i   determine whether the services offered or provided by the division under the child        and family plan constitute  reasonable efforts  on the part of the division               ii   determine and define the responsibilities of the parent under the child and family        plan in accordance with Subsection   A  a        e   and              iii   identify verbally on the record, or in a written document provided to the parties,        the responsibilities described in Subsection      a  ii , for the purpose of assisting in any future        determination regarding the provision of reasonable efforts, in accordance with state and        federal law.              b   If the parent is in a substance abuse treatment program, other than a certified drug        court program               i   the court may order the parent to submit to supplementary drug or alcohol testing in        addition to the testing recommended by the parent s substance abuse program based on a        finding of reasonable suspicion that the parent is abusing drugs or alcohol  and              ii   the court may order the parent to provide the results of drug or alcohol testing        recommended by the substance abuse program to the court or division.                   a   The time period for reunification services may not exceed    months from the        date that the minor was initially removed from the minor s home, unless the time period is        extended under Subsection   A         .              b   Nothing in this section may be construed to entitle any parent to an entire           months of reunification services.                   a   If reunification services are ordered, the court may terminate those services at        any time.              b   If, at any time, continuation of reasonable efforts to reunify a minor is determined        to be inconsistent with the final permanency plan for the minor established pursuant to Section          A      , then measures shall be taken, in a timely manner, to               i   place the minor in accordance with the permanency plan  and              ii   complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the        minor.                   Any physical custody of the minor by the parent or a relative during the period        described in Subsections      through      does not interrupt the running of the period.                   a   If reunification services are ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted        by the court in accordance with Section   A       at the expiration of the time period for        reunification services.              b   The permanency hearing shall be held no later than    months after the original        removal of the minor.              c   If reunification services are not ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted        within    days, in accordance with Section   A      .                   With regard to a minor in the custody of the division whose parent or parents are        ordered to receive reunification services but who have abandoned that minor for a period of six        months from the date that reunification services were ordered               a   the court shall terminate reunification services  and              b   the division shall petition the court for termination of parental rights.                   When a court conducts a permanency hearing for a minor under Section          A      , the court shall attempt to keep the minor s sibling group together if keeping the        sibling group together is               a   practicable  and              b   in accordance with the best interest of the minor.                   When siblings are separated, a court may order sibling visitation according to the        court s determination of the best interests of the child for whom the hearing is held.                          a   Because of the state s interest in and responsibility to protect and provide        permanency for minors who are abused, neglected, or dependent, the Legislature finds that a        parent s interest in receiving reunification services is limited.              b   The court may determine that               i   efforts to reunify a minor with the minor s family are not reasonable or appropriate,        based on the individual circumstances  and              ii   reunification services should not be provided.              c   In determining  reasonable efforts  to be made with respect to a minor, and in        making  reasonable efforts,  the minor s health, safety, and welfare shall be the paramount        concern.                          There is a presumption that reunification services should not be provided to        a parent if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that any of the following        circumstances exist               a   the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, based upon a verified affidavit        indicating that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent               b   subject to Subsection             a , the parent is suffering from a mental illness of        such magnitude that it renders the parent incapable of utilizing reunification services               c   the minor was previously adjudicated as an abused child due to physical abuse,        sexual abuse, or sexual exploitation, and following the adjudication the minor               i   was removed from the custody of the minor s parent               ii   was subsequently returned to the custody of the parent  and              iii   is being removed due to additional physical abuse, sexual abuse, or sexual        exploitation               d   the parent               i   caused the death of another minor through abuse or neglect               ii   committed, aided, abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to commit               A   murder or manslaughter of a child  or              B   child abuse homicide               iii   committed sexual abuse against the child               iv   is a registered sex offender or required to register as a sex offender  or              v   A   intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes the death of another parent of the        child               B   is identified by a law enforcement agency as the primary suspect in an investigation        for intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causing the death of another parent of the child  or              C   is being prosecuted for or has been convicted of intentionally, knowingly, or        recklessly causing the death of another parent of the child               e   the minor suffered severe abuse by the parent or by any person known by the        parent, if the parent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was abusing the        minor               f   the minor is adjudicated an abused child as a result of severe abuse by the parent,        and the court finds that it would not benefit the minor to pursue reunification services with the        offending parent               g   the parent s rights are terminated with regard to any other minor               h   the minor was removed from the minor s home on at least two previous occasions        and reunification services were offered or provided to the family at those times               i   the parent has abandoned the minor for a period of six months or longer               j   the parent permitted the child to reside, on a permanent or temporary basis, at a        location where the parent knew or should have known that a clandestine laboratory operation        was located               k   except as provided in Subsection             b , with respect to a parent who is the        child s birth mother, the child has fetal alcohol syndrome, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, or        was exposed to an illegal or prescription drug that was abused by the child s mother while the        child was in utero, if the child was taken into division custody for that reason, unless the        mother agrees to enroll in, is currently enrolled in, or has recently and successfully completed a        substance abuse treatment program approved by the department  or              l   any other circumstance that the court determines should preclude reunification        efforts or services.                          a   The finding under Subsection             b  shall be based on competent        evidence from at least two medical or mental health professionals, who are not associates,        establishing that, even with the provision of services, the parent is not likely to be capable of        adequately caring for the minor within    months after the day on which the court finding is        made.              b   A judge may disregard the provisions of Subsection             k  if the court finds,        under the circumstances of the case, that the substance abuse treatment described in Subsection                    k  is not warranted.                          In determining whether reunification services are appropriate, the court        shall take into consideration               a   failure of the parent to respond to previous services or comply with a previous child        and family plan               b   the fact that the minor was abused while the parent was under the influence of        drugs or alcohol               c   any history of violent behavior directed at the child or an immediate family        member               d   whether a parent continues to live with an individual who abused the minor               e   any patterns of the parent s behavior that have exposed the minor to repeated abuse               f   testimony by a competent professional that the parent s behavior is unlikely to be        successful  and              g   whether the parent has expressed an interest in reunification with the minor.                          a   If reunification services are not ordered pursuant to Subsections                    through            , and the whereabouts of a parent become known within six months        after the day on which the out of home placement of the minor is made, the court may order        the division to provide reunification services.              b   The time limits described in Subsections     through      are not tolled by the        parent s absence.                          a   If a parent is incarcerated or institutionalized, the court shall order        reasonable services unless it determines that those services would be detrimental to the minor.              b   In making the determination described in Subsection             a , the court shall        consider               i   the age of the minor               ii   the degree of parent child bonding               iii   the length of the sentence               iv   the nature of the treatment               v   the nature of the crime or illness               vi   the degree of detriment to the minor if services are not offered               vii   for a minor    years old or older, the minor s attitude toward the implementation        of family reunification services  and              viii   any other appropriate factors.              c   Reunification services for an incarcerated parent are subject to the time limitations        imposed in Subsections     through     .              d   Reunification services for an institutionalized parent are subject to the time        limitations imposed in Subsections     through     , unless the court determines that continued        reunification services would be in the minor s best interest.                          If, pursuant to Subsections             b  through  l , the court does not        order reunification services, a permanency hearing shall be conducted within    days, in        accordance with Section   A      .Legislative Review NoteOffice of Legislative Research and General Counsel
