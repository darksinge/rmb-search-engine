Section          is amended to read                     . Letters upon several estates jointly.                Upon application or petition by any person interested in two or more estates, the       registrar may, in an informal proceeding without a hearing, or the court may, in a formal       proceeding after notice and hearing, grant letters upon these estates jointly if administration has       not commenced with respect to  any such  the estate and if              a    All  all or any part of the estate of one decedent has descended from another       decedent  or             b    Two  two or more decedents held any property during their lifetimes as       tenants in common and if the persons entitled under the wills of these decedents or under the       law of intestate succession to receive the estates of these decedents are the same.                 If letters are granted upon two or more estates jointly under this section, these       estates shall be administered the same as if they were but one estate except that claims may be       enforced only against the estate to which they relate.            Section  .  Section          is amended to read                     . Formal testacy or appointment proceedings    Petition    Contents.                 Petitions for formal probate of a will, or for adjudication of intestacy with or       without request for appointment of a personal representative, shall be directed to the court,       request a judicial order after notice and hearing, and contain further statements as indicated in       this section.  A petition for formal probate of a will              a   requests an order as to the testacy of the decedent in relation to a particular       instrument which may or may not have been informally probated and determining the heirs              b   contains the statements required for informal applications as stated in Subsection                   and the statements required by Subsections             b  and  c , and, if the       petition requests appointment of a personal representative, the statements required by       Subsection              and             c   states whether the original of the last will of the decedent is in the possession of the       court, accompanies the petition, or was presented to the court for electronic storage or       electronic filing and is  not  in the possession of the petitioner or the petitioner s attorney.                 If the original will is not in the possession of the court, has not been presented to       the court for electronic storage or electronic filing, does not accompany the petition, and no       authenticated copy of a will probated in another jurisdiction accompanies the petition, the       petition also shall state the contents of the will and indicate that it is lost, destroyed, or       otherwise unavailable.                 A petition for adjudication of intestacy and appointment of an administrator in       intestacy shall request a judicial finding and order that the decedent left no will and,       determining the heirs, contain the statements required by Subsections             and                   and indicate whether supervised administration is sought.  A petition may request       an order determining intestacy and heirs without requesting the appointment of an       administrator, in which case, the statements required by Subsection             b  may be       omitted.            Section  .  Section          is amended to read                     . Findings    Limited guardianship preferred    Order of appointment.                 The court may appoint a guardian as requested if it is satisfied that the person for       whom a guardian is sought is incapacitated and that the appointment is necessary or desirable       as a means of providing continuing care and supervision of the incapacitated person.                 a   The court shall prefer a limited guardianship and may only grant a full       guardianship if no other alternative exists.  If the court does not grant a limited guardianship, a       specific finding shall be made that nothing less than a full guardianship is adequate.             b   An order of appointment of a limited guardianship shall state the limitations of the       guardianship. Letters of guardianship for a limited guardianship shall state the limitations of       the guardianship unless the court determines for good cause shown that a limitation should not       be listed in the letters.                 A guardian appointed by will or written instrument, under Section         , whose       appointment has not been prevented or nullified under Subsection            , has priority       over any guardian who may be appointed by the court, but the court may proceed with an       appointment upon a finding that the testamentary or instrumental guardian has failed to accept       the appointment within    days after notice of the guardianship proceeding.  Alternatively, the       court may dismiss the proceeding or enter any other appropriate order.            Section  .  Section          is amended to read                     .

If an incapacitated person has no guardian and an emergency exists or if an        appointed guardian is not effectively performing the guardian s duties and the court further        finds that the welfare of the incapacitated person requires immediate action, it may, without        notice, appoint an emergency guardian for the person for a specified period not to exceed           days pending notice and hearing.

Section  .  Section          is amended to read                      . General powers and duties of guardian    Penalties.                  A guardian of an incapacitated person has only the powers, rights, and duties        respecting the ward granted in the order of appointment under Section         .                  Except as provided in Subsection    , a guardian has the same powers, rights, and        duties respecting the ward that a parent has respecting the parent s unemancipated minor child.                  In particular, and without qualifying the foregoing, a guardian has the following        powers and duties, except as modified by order of the court               a   To the extent that it is consistent with the terms of any order by a court of        competent jurisdiction relating to detention or commitment of the ward, the guardian is entitled        to custody of the person of the ward and may establish the ward s place of abode within or        without this state.              b   If entitled to custody of the ward the guardian shall provide for the care, comfort,        and maintenance of the ward and, whenever appropriate, arrange for the ward s training and        education.  Without regard to custodial rights of the ward s person, the guardian shall take        reasonable care of the ward s clothing, furniture, vehicles, and other personal effects and        commence protective proceedings if other property of the ward is in need of protection.              c   A guardian may give any consents or approvals that may be necessary to enable the        ward to receive medical or other professional care, counsel, treatment, or service.              d   A guardian may not unreasonably restrict visitation with the ward by family,        relatives, or friends.              e   If no conservator for the estate of the ward has been appointed, the guardian may               i   institute proceedings to compel any person under a duty to support the ward or to        pay sums for the welfare of the ward to perform that duty               ii   compel the production of the ward s estate documents, including the ward s will,        trust, power of attorney, and any advance health care directive  and              iii   receive money and tangible property deliverable to the ward and apply the money        and property for support, care, and education of the ward  but the guardian may not use funds        from the ward s estate for room and board which the guardian, the guardian s spouse, parent, or        child have furnished the ward unless a charge for the service is approved by order of the court        made upon notice to at least one adult relative in the nearest degree of kinship to the ward in        which there is an adult.  The guardian shall exercise care to conserve any excess for the ward s        needs.              f   i   A guardian is required to report the condition of the ward and of the estate which        has been subject to the guardian s possession or control, as required by the court or court rule.              ii   A guardian is required to immediately notify all interested persons if the guardian        reasonably believes that the ward s death is likely to occur within the next    days, based on               A   the guardian s own observations  or              B   information from the ward s physician or other medical care providers.              iii   A guardian is required to immediately notify all interested persons of the ward s        death.              iv   Unless emergency conditions exist, a guardian is required to file with the court a        notice of the guardian s intent to move the ward and to serve the notice on all interested persons        at least    days before the move.  The guardian shall take reasonable steps to notify all        interested persons and to file the notice with the court as soon as practicable following the        earlier of the move or the date when the guardian s intention to move the ward is made known        to the ward, the ward s care giver, or any other third party.              v   The   A   If no conservator for the estate of the ward has been appointed, the        guardian shall, for all estates in excess of    ,   , excluding the residence owned by the ward,        send a report with a full accounting to the court on an annual basis.              B   For estates less than    ,   , excluding the residence owned by the ward, the        guardian shall fill out an informal annual report and mail the report to the court.              C    The  A report under Subsection     f  v  A  or  B  shall include  the following   a        statement of assets at the beginning and end of the reporting year, income received during the        year, disbursements for the support of the ward, and other expenses incurred by the estate.  The        guardian shall also report the physical conditions of the ward, the place of residence, and a list        of others living in the same household.  The court may require additional information.

This               E   An annual report shall be examined and approved by the court.              F   If the ward s income is limited to a federal or state program requiring an annual        accounting report, a copy of that report may be submitted to the court in lieu of the required        annual report.              vi   Corporate fiduciaries are not required to petition the court, but shall submit their        internal report annually to the court.  The report shall be examined and approved by the court.              vii   The guardian shall also render an annual accounting of the status of the person to        the court which shall be included in the petition or the informal annual report as required under        Subsection     f .  If a fee is paid for an accounting of an estate, no fee shall be charged for an        accounting of the status of a person.              viii   If a guardian               A   makes a substantial misstatement on filings of annual reports               B   is guilty of gross impropriety in handling the property of the ward  or              C   willfully fails to file the report required by this subsection, after receiving written        notice from the court of the failure to file and after a grace period of two months has elapsed,        the court may impose a penalty in an amount not to exceed   ,   .  The court may also order        restitution of funds misappropriated from the estate of a ward.

Any guardian of one for whom a conservator also has been appointed shall control        the custody and care of the ward and is entitled to receive reasonable sums for services and for        room and board furnished to the ward as agreed upon between the guardian and the        conservator, if the amounts agreed upon are reasonable under the circumstances.  The guardian        may request the conservator to expend the ward s estate by payment to third persons or        institutions for the ward s care and maintenance.             Section  .  Section          is amended to read                      . Inventory and records.

The estate of the protected person does not include the assets of a trust.                  The conservator shall provide a copy of the inventory to the protected person if the        person               a   can be located               b   has attained the age of    years  and              c   has sufficient mental capacity to understand these matters, and to any parent or        guardian with whom the protected person resides.                  The conservator shall keep suitable  administrative  financial records and produce        them upon the request of any interested person.             Section  .  Section          is amended to read                      . Recording of conservator s letters.                  a   Letters of conservatorship are evidence of transfer of  all  the assets of a        protected person to the conservator.              b   An order terminating a conservatorship is evidence of transfer of  all  the assets of        the estate from the conservator to the protected person or  his  the protected person s        successors.              c   Subject to the requirements of general statutes governing the filing or recordation of        documents of title to land or other property, letters of conservatorship and orders terminating        conservatorships may be filed or recorded to give record notice of title as between the        conservator and the protected person.                  A person who refuses to accept the authority of a conservator to transact business        with the assets of the protected person after receiving a certified copy of letters of        conservatorship is liable for costs, expenses, attorney fees, and damages if the court determines        that the person did not act in good faith in refusing to accept the authority of the conservator.             Section  .  Section          is amended to read                      . Powers of conservator in administration.                  A conservator has all of the powers conferred in this chapter and any additional        powers conferred by law on trustees in this state.  In addition, a conservator of the estate of an        unmarried minor as to whom no one has parental rights, has the duties and powers of a        guardian of a minor described in Section          until the minor attains majority or marries,        but the parental rights so conferred on a conservator do not preclude appointment of a guardian        as provided by Part  , Guardians of Minors.                  a   A conservator has the power to compel the production of the protected person s        estate documents, including the protected person s will, trust, power of attorney, and any        advance health care directives.              b   If a guardian is also appointed for the ward, the conservator shall share with the        guardian the estate documents the conservator receives.                  A conservator has power without court authorization or confirmation to invest and        reinvest funds of the estate as would a trustee.                  A conservator, acting reasonably in efforts to accomplish the purpose for which the        conservator was appointed, may act without court authorization or confirmation, to               a   collect,

A conservator may expend or distribute income or principal of the estate without        court authorization or confirmation for the support, education, care, or benefit of the protected        person and  his  the protected person s dependents in accordance with the following principles               a   The conservator is to consider recommendations relating to the appropriate standard        of support, education, and benefit for the protected person made by a parent or guardian, if any.         He  A conservator may not be surcharged for sums paid to persons or organizations actually        furnishing support, education, or care to the protected person pursuant to the recommendations        of a parent or guardian of the protected person unless  he  the conservator knows that the        parent or guardian is deriving personal financial benefit therefrom, including relief from any        personal duty of support, or unless the recommendations are clearly not in the best interests of        the protected person.              b   The conservator is to expend or distribute sums reasonably necessary for the        support, education, care or benefit of the protected person with due regard to               i   the size of the estate, the probable duration of the conservatorship and the likelihood        that the protected person, at some future time, may be fully able to manage the protected        person s affairs and the estate which has been conserved for the protected person               ii   the accustomed standard of living of the protected person and members of the        protected person s household  and              iii   other funds or sources used for the support of the protected person.              c   The conservator may expend funds of the estate for the support of persons legally        dependent on the protected person and others who are members of the protected person s        household who are unable to support themselves and who are in need of support.              d   Funds expended under this Subsection     may be paid by the conservator to any        person, including the protected person to reimburse for expenditures which the conservator        might have made, or in advance for services to be rendered to the protected person when it is        reasonable to expect that they will be performed and where advance payments are customary or        reasonably necessary under the circumstances.                  If the estate is ample to provide for the purposes implicit in the distributions        authorized by Subsection    , a conservator for a protected person other than a minor has power        to make gifts to charity and other objects as the protected person might have been expected to        make, in amounts which do not exceed in total for any year     of the income from the estate.                  When a person who is a minor and who has not been adjudged to have a disability        under Subsection             a  attains the age of majority, the person s conservator, after        meeting all prior claims and expenses of administration, shall pay over and distribute all funds        and properties to the former protected person as soon as possible.                  When the conservator is satisfied that a protected person s disability   , other than        minority   , has ceased, the conservator, after meeting all prior claims and expenses of        administration, shall pay over and distribute all funds and properties to the former protected        person as soon as possible.                  If a protected person dies, the conservator               a   shall               i   deliver to the court for safekeeping any will of the deceased protected person that        may have come into the conservator s possession               ii   inform the  executor  personal representative or a beneficiary named in the will that        the conservator has done so  and              iii   retain the estate for delivery to a duly appointed personal representative of the        decedent or other persons entitled to it               b   may continue to pay the obligations lawfully due against the estate and to protect        the estate from waste, injury, or damages that might reasonably be foreseeable  and              c   may apply to exercise the powers and duties of a personal representative so that the        conservator may proceed to administer and distribute the decedent s estate without additional or        further appointment, provided that at least    days from the death of the protected person no        other person has been appointed personal representative and no application or petition for        appointment is before the court.                  Upon application for an order granting the powers of a personal representative to a        conservator as provided in Subsection     c  and after notice as provided in Section         ,        the court may order the conferral of the power upon determining that there is no objection and        endorse the letters of the conservator to note that the formerly protected person is deceased and        that the conservator has acquired all of the powers and duties of a personal representative.  The        making and entry of an order under this section shall have the effect of an order of appointment        of a personal representative as provided in Section          and Chapter  , Part  , Personal        Representative   Appointment, Control, and Termination of Authority, Part  , Duties and        Powers of Personal Representatives, Part  , Creditors  Claims, Part  , Special Provisions        Relating to Distribution, and Part   , Closing Estates, except that the estate in the name of the        conservator, after administration, may be distributed to the decedent s successors without prior        retransfer to the conservator as personal representative.Legislative Review NoteOffice of Legislative Research and General Counsel
