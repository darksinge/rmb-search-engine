A child may receive services from a local mental health authority in an inpatient or         residential setting only after a commitment proceeding, for the purpose of transferring physical         custody, has been conducted in accordance with the requirements of this section.                   That commitment proceeding shall be initiated by a petition for commitment, and         shall be a careful, diagnostic inquiry, conducted by a neutral and detached fact finder, pursuant         to the procedures and requirements of this section.  If the findings described in Subsection             exist, the proceeding shall result in the transfer of physical custody to the appropriate local         mental health authority, and the child may be placed in an inpatient or residential setting.                   The neutral and detached fact finder who conducts the inquiry                a   shall be a designated examiner, as defined in Subsection   A            and               b   may not profit, financially or otherwise, from the commitment or physical         placement of the child in that setting.

Those parties shall also         be afforded an opportunity to appear and to address the petition for commitment.               c   The neutral and detached fact finder may, in his discretion, receive the testimony of         any other person.               d   The fact finder may allow the child to waive his right to be present at the         commitment proceeding, for good cause shown.  If that right is waived, the purpose of the         waiver shall be made a matter of record at the proceeding.               e   At the time of the commitment proceeding, the appropriate local mental health         authority, its designee, or the psychiatrist who has been in charge of the child s care prior to the         commitment proceeding, shall provide the neutral and detached fact finder with the following         information, as it relates to the period of current admission                i   the petition for commitment                ii   the admission notes                iii   the child s diagnosis                iv   physicians  orders                v   progress notes                vi   nursing notes  and               vii   medication records.               f   The information described in Subsection     e  shall also be provided to the child s         parent or legal guardian upon written request.               g   i   The neutral and detached fact finder s decision of commitment shall state the         duration of the commitment.  Any commitment to the physical custody of a local mental health         authority may not exceed     days.  Prior to expiration of the commitment, and if further         commitment is sought, a hearing shall be conducted in the same manner as the initial         commitment proceeding, in accordance with the requirements of this section.               ii   When a decision for commitment is made, the neutral and detached fact finder shall         inform the child and his parent or legal guardian of that decision, and of the reasons for         ordering commitment at the conclusion of the hearing, and also in writing.               iii   The neutral and detached fact finder shall state in writing the basis of his decision,         with specific reference to each of the criteria described in Subsection    , as a matter of record.

A         child temporarily committed in accordance with those emergency procedures may be held for a         maximum of    hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.  At the expiration of         that time period, the child shall be released unless the procedures and findings required by this         section have been satisfied.                   A local mental health authority shall have physical custody of each child committed         to it under this section.  The parent or legal guardian of a child committed to the physical         custody of a local mental health authority under this section, retains legal custody of the child,         unless legal custody has been otherwise modified by a court of competent jurisdiction.  In cases         when the Division of Child and Family Services or the Division of Juvenile Justice Services         has legal custody of a child, that division shall retain legal custody for purposes of this part.                   The cost of caring for and maintaining a child in the physical custody of a local         mental health authority shall be assessed to and paid by the child s parents, according to their         ability to pay.  For purposes of this section, the Division of Child and Family Services or the         Division of Juvenile Justice Services shall be financially responsible, in addition to the child s         parents, if the child is in the legal custody of either of those divisions at the time the child is         committed to the physical custody of a local mental health authority under this section, unless         Medicaid regulation or contract provisions specify otherwise.  The Office of Recovery Services         shall assist those divisions in collecting the costs assessed pursuant to this section.                   Whenever application is made for commitment of a minor to a local mental health         authority under any provision of this section by a person other than the child s parent or         guardian, the local mental health authority or its designee shall notify the child s parent or         guardian.  The parents shall be provided sufficient time to prepare and appear at any scheduled         proceeding.                    a   Each child committed pursuant to this section is entitled to an appeal within            days after any order for commitment.  The appeal may be brought on the child s own petition,         or that of his parent or legal guardian, to the juvenile court in the district where the child         resides or is currently physically located.  With regard to a child in the custody of the Division         of Child and Family Services or the Division of Juvenile Justice Services, the attorney general s         office shall handle the appeal, otherwise the appropriate county attorney s office is responsible         for appeals brought pursuant to this Subsection      a .               b   Upon receipt of the petition for appeal, the court shall appoint a designated         examiner previously unrelated to the case, to conduct an examination of the child in accordance         with the criteria described in Subsection    , and file a written report with the court.  The court         shall then conduct an appeal hearing to determine whether the findings described in Subsection             exist by clear and convincing evidence.               c   Prior to the time of the appeal hearing, the appropriate local mental health authority,         its designee, or the mental health professional who has been in charge of the child s care prior         to commitment, shall provide the court and the designated examiner for the appeal hearing with         the following information, as it relates to the period of current admission                i   the original petition for commitment                ii   admission notes                iii   diagnosis                iv   physicians  orders                v   progress notes                vi   nursing notes  and               vii   medication records.               d   Both the neutral and detached fact finder and the designated examiner appointed for         the appeal hearing shall be provided with an opportunity to review the most current         information described in Subsection      c  prior to the appeal hearing.               e   The child, his parent or legal guardian, the person who submitted the original         petition for commitment, and a representative of the appropriate local mental health authority         shall be notified by the court of the date and time of the appeal hearing.  Those persons shall be         afforded an opportunity to appear at the hearing.  In reaching its decision, the court shall review         the record and findings of the neutral and detached fact finder, the report of the designated         examiner appointed pursuant to Subsection      b , and may, in its discretion, allow or require         the testimony of the neutral and detached fact finder, the designated examiner, the child, the         child s parent or legal guardian, the person who brought the initial petition for commitment, or         any other person whose testimony the court deems relevant.  The court may allow the child to         waive his right to appear at the appeal hearing, for good cause shown.  If that waiver is granted,         the purpose shall be made a part of the court s record.                    Each local mental health authority has an affirmative duty to conduct periodic         evaluations of the mental health and treatment progress of every child committed to its physical         custody under this section, and to release any child who has sufficiently improved so that the         criteria justifying commitment no longer exist.                    a   A local mental health authority or its designee, in conjunction with the child s         current treating mental health professional may release an improved child to a less restrictive         environment, as they determine appropriate.  Whenever the local mental health authority or its         designee, and the child s current treating mental health professional, determine that the         conditions justifying commitment no longer exist, the child shall be discharged and released to         his parent or legal guardian.  With regard to a child who is in the physical custody of the State         Hospital, the treating psychiatrist or clinical director of the State Hospital shall be the child s         current treating mental health professional.               b   A local mental health authority or its designee, in conjunction with the child s         current treating mental health professional, is authorized to issue a written order for the         immediate placement of a child not previously released from an order of commitment into a         more restrictive environment, if the local authority or its designee and the child s current         treating mental health professional has reason to believe that the less restrictive environment in         which the child has been placed is exacerbating his mental illness, or increasing the risk of         harm to himself or others.               c   The written order described in Subsection      b  shall include the reasons for         placement in a more restrictive environment and shall authorize any peace officer to take the         child into physical custody and transport him to a facility designated by the appropriate local         mental health authority in conjunction with the child s current treating mental health         professional.  Prior to admission to the more restrictive environment, copies of the order shall         be personally delivered to the child, his parent or legal guardian, the administrator of the more         restrictive environment, or his designee, and the child s former treatment provider or facility.               d   If the child has been in a less restrictive environment for more than    days and is         aggrieved by the change to a more restrictive environment, the child or his representative may         request a review within    days of the change, by a neutral and detached fact finder as         described in Subsection    .  The fact finder shall determine whether                i   the less restrictive environment in which the child has been placed is exacerbating         his mental illness, or increasing the risk of harm to himself or others  or               ii   the less restrictive environment in which the child has been placed is not         exacerbating his mental illness, or increasing the risk of harm to himself or others, in which         case the fact finder shall designate that the child remain in the less restrictive environment.               e   Nothing in this section prevents a local mental health authority or its designee, in         conjunction with the child s current mental health professional, from discharging a child from         commitment or from placing a child in an environment that is less restrictive than that         designated by the neutral and detached fact finder.                    Each local mental health authority or its designee, in conjunction with the child s         current treating mental health professional shall discharge any child who, in the opinion of that         local authority, or its designee, and the child s current treating mental health professional, no         longer meets the criteria specified in Subsection    , except as provided by Section   A      .          The local authority and the mental health professional shall assure that any further supportive         services required to meet the child s needs upon release will be provided.                    Even though a child has been committed to the physical custody of a local mental         health authority pursuant to this section, the child is still entitled to additional due process         proceedings, in accordance with Section   A       , before any treatment which may affect a         constitutionally protected liberty or privacy interest is administered.  Those treatments include,         but are not limited to, antipsychotic medication, electroshock therapy, and psychosurgery.              Section   .
