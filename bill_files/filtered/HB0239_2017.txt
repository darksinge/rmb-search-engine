In any prosecution for a violation of this chapter, evidence or proof that shows a         person or persons produced, manufactured, possessed, distributed, or dispensed a controlled         substance or substances, is prima facie evidence that the person or persons did so with         knowledge of the character of the substance or substances.

If the defense is established, it is a complete defense to the         charges.                    a   It is an affirmative defense that the person produced, possessed, or         administered a controlled substance listed in Section        .  if the person                i   was engaged in medical research  and               ii   was a holder of a valid license to possess controlled substances under Section                .               b   It is not a defense under Subsection      a  that the person prescribed or dispensed         a controlled substance listed in Section        . .

Except to the extent provided by rule, the division is not responsible for         investigating domestic violence in the presence of a child, as described in Section         . .                   The division may not require a parent who has a child in the custody of the division         to pay for some or all of the cost of any drug testing the parent is required to undergo.              Section   .  Section   A  a     is amended to read                 A  a    . Rights of parents    Children s rights    Interest and responsibility of         state.                   a   Under both the United States Constitution and the constitution of this state, a         parent possesses a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of the         parent s children.  A fundamentally fair process must be provided to parents if the state moves         to challenge or interfere with parental rights.  A governmental entity must support any actions         or allegations made in opposition to the rights and desires of a parent regarding the parent s         children by sufficient evidence to satisfy a parent s constitutional entitlement to heightened         protection against government interference with the parent s fundamental rights and liberty         interests and, concomitantly, the right of the child to be reared by the child s natural parent.               b   The fundamental liberty interest of a parent concerning the care, custody, and         management of the parent s children is recognized, protected, and does not cease to exist         simply because a parent may fail to be a model parent or because the parent s child is placed in         the temporary custody of the state.  At all times, a parent retains a vital interest in preventing         the irretrievable destruction of family life.  Prior to an adjudication of unfitness, government         action in relation to parents and their children may not exceed the least restrictive means or         alternatives available to accomplish a compelling state interest.  Until the state proves parental         unfitness, and the child suffers, or is substantially likely to suffer, serious detriment as a result,         the child and the child s parents share a vital interest in preventing erroneous termination of         their natural relationship and the state cannot presume that a child and the child s parents are         adversaries.               c   It is in the best interest and welfare of a child to be raised under the care and         supervision of the child s natural parents.  A child s need for a normal family life in a         permanent home, and for positive, nurturing family relationships is usually best met by the         child s natural parents.  Additionally, the integrity of the family unit and the right of parents to         conceive and raise their children are constitutionally protected.  The right of a fit, competent         parent to raise the parent s child without undue government interference is a fundamental         liberty interest that has long been protected by the laws and Constitution and is a fundamental         public policy of this state.               d   The state recognizes that                i   a parent has the right, obligation, responsibility, and authority to raise, manage,         train, educate, provide and care for, and reasonably discipline the parent s children  and               ii   the state s role is secondary and supportive to the primary role of a parent.               e   It is the public policy of this state that parents retain the fundamental right and duty         to exercise primary control over the care, supervision, upbringing, and education of their         children.               f   Subsections     through     shall be interpreted and applied consistent with this         Subsection    .                   It is also the public policy of this state that children have the right to protection         from abuse and neglect, and that the state retains a compelling interest in investigating,         prosecuting, and punishing abuse and neglect, as defined in this chapter, and in Title   A,         Chapter  , Juvenile Court Act  of      .  Therefore, the state, as parens patriae, has an interest         in and responsibility to protect children whose parents abuse them or do not adequately provide         for their welfare.  There may be circumstances where a parent s conduct or condition is a         substantial departure from the norm and the parent is unable or unwilling to render safe and         proper parental care and protection.  Under those circumstances, the state may take action for         the welfare and protection of the parent s children.                   When the division intervenes on behalf of an abused, neglected, or dependent child,         it shall take into account the child s need for protection from immediate harm and the extent to         which the child s extended family may provide needed protection.  Throughout its involvement,         the division shall utilize the least intrusive and least restrictive means available to protect a         child, in an effort to ensure that children are brought up in stable, permanent families, rather         than in temporary foster placements under the supervision of the state.                   When circumstances within the family pose a threat to the child s immediate safety         or welfare, the division may seek custody of the child for a planned, temporary period and         place the child in a safe environment, subject to the requirements of this section and in         accordance with the requirements of Title   A, Chapter  , Part  , Abuse, Neglect, and         Dependency Proceedings, and                a   when safe and appropriate, return the child to the child s parent  or               b   as a last resort, pursue another permanency plan.                   In determining and making  reasonable efforts  with regard to a child, pursuant to         the provisions of Section   A  a    , both the division s and the court s paramount concern         shall be the child s health, safety, and welfare.  The desires of a parent for the parent s child,         and the constitutionally protected rights of a parent, as described in this section, shall be given         full and serious consideration by the division and the court.                   In cases where actual sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abandonment, severe         abuse, or severe neglect are established, the state has no duty to make  reasonable efforts  or         to, in any other way, attempt to maintain a child in the child s home, provide reunification         services, or to attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.  This Subsection     does         not exempt the division from providing court ordered services.                   a   In accordance with Subsection    , the division shall strive to achieve         appropriate permanency for children who are abused, neglected, or dependent.  The division         shall provide in home services, where appropriate and safe, in an effort to help a parent to         correct the behavior that resulted in abuse, neglect, or dependency of the parent s child. The         division may pursue a foster placement only if in home services fail or are otherwise         insufficient or inappropriate, kinship placement is not safe or appropriate, or in home services         and kinship placement fail and cannot be corrected. The division shall also seek qualified         extended family support or a kinship placement to maintain a sense of security and stability for         the child.               b   If the use or continuation of  reasonable efforts,  as described in Subsections             and    , is determined to be inconsistent with the permanency plan for a child, then measures         shall be taken, in a timely manner, to place the child in accordance with the permanency plan,         and to complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child.               c   Subject to the parental rights recognized and protected under this section, if,          because of a parent s conduct or condition, the parent is determined to be unfit or incompetent         based on the grounds for termination of parental rights described in Title   A, Chapter  , Part          , Termination of Parental Rights Act, the continuing welfare and best interest of the child is of         paramount importance, and shall be protected in determining whether that parent s rights         should be terminated.

A   a validated risk and needs assessment indicates that the minor needs residential         treatment and nonresidential treatment options have been exhausted  and               B   the minor is adjudicated under this section for a felony offense, a misdemeanor         when the minor has five prior misdemeanors or felony adjudications arising from separate         criminal episodes, or a misdemeanor involving the use of a dangerous weapon.               ii   The court may not vest legal custody of a minor in the Division of Juvenile Justice         Services for                A   contempt of court except to the extent permitted under Section   A                       B   a violation of probation                C   failure to pay a fine, fee, restitution, or other financial obligation                D   unfinished compensatory or community service hours                E   an infraction  or               F   a status offense.                iv    iii   A   A minor who is    years old or older, but younger than    years old,         may petition the court to express the minor s desire to be removed from the jurisdiction of the         juvenile court and from the custody of the Division of Child and Family Services if the minor         is in the division s custody on grounds of abuse, neglect, or dependency.               B   If the minor s parent s rights have not been terminated in accordance with Part  ,         Termination of Parental Rights Act, the minor s petition shall contain a statement from the         minor s parent or guardian agreeing that the minor should be removed from the custody of the         Division of Child and Family Services.               C   The minor and the minor s parent or guardian shall sign the petition.               D   The court shall review the petition within    days.               E   The court shall remove the minor from the custody of the Division of Child and         Family Services if the minor and the minor s parent or guardian have met the requirements         described in Subsections     c  iv  B  and  C  and if the court finds, based on input from the         Division of Child and Family Services, the minor s guardian ad litem, and the Office of the         Attorney General, that the minor does not pose an imminent threat to self or others.               F   A minor removed from custody under Subsection     c  iv  E  may, within    days         of the date of removal, petition the court to re enter custody of the Division of Child and         Family Services.               G   Upon receiving a petition under Subsection     c  iv  F , the court shall order the         Division of Child and Family Services to take custody of the minor based on the findings the         court entered when the court originally vested custody in the Division of Child and Family         Services.               d   i   The court  may  shall only commit a minor to the Division of Juvenile Justice         Services for secure confinement .  if the court finds that the minor poses a risk of harm to         others and is adjudicated under this section for                A   a felony offense                B   a misdemeanor if the minor has five prior misdemeanor or felony adjudications         arising from separate criminal episodes  or               C   a misdemeanor involving use of a firearm.               ii   A minor under the jurisdiction of the court solely on the ground of abuse, neglect,         or dependency under Subsection   A           c   b  may not be committed to the Division of         Juvenile Justice Services.               iii   The court may not commit a minor to the Division of Juvenile Justice Services for         secure confinement for                A   contempt of court                B   a violation of probation                C   failure to pay a fine, fee, restitution, or other financial obligation                D   unfinished compensatory or community service hours                E   an infraction  or               F   a status offense.               e   The court may  commit a minor, subject to the court retaining continuing         jurisdiction over the minor, to the temporary custody of the Division of Juvenile Justice         Services for observation and evaluation for a period not to exceed    days, which period may         be extended up to    days at the request of the director of the Division of Juvenile Justice         Services  order nonresidential, diagnostic assessment, including substance use disorder, mental         health, psychological, or sexual behavior risk assessment.               f   i   The court may commit a minor to a place of detention or an alternative to         detention for a period not to exceed    cumulative days per adjudication subject to the court         retaining continuing jurisdiction over the minor.  This commitment may not be  stayed or          suspended upon conditions ordered by the court.               ii   This Subsection     f  applies only to a minor adjudicated for                A   an act which if committed by an adult would be a criminal offense  or               B   contempt of court under Section   A       .               iii   The court may not commit a minor to a place of detention for                A   contempt of court except to the extent allowed under Section   A                       B   a violation of probation                C   failure to pay a fine, fee, restitution, or other financial obligation                D   unfinished compensatory or community service hours                E   an infraction  or               F   a status offense.               iv   A   Time spent in detention pre adjudication shall be credited toward the            cumulative days eligible as a disposition under Subsection     f  i . If the minor spent more         than    days in a place of detention before disposition, the court may not commit a minor to         detention under this section.               B   Notwithstanding Subsection     f  iv  A , the court may commit a minor for a         maximum of seven days while a minor is awaiting placement under Subsection     c  i . Only         the seven days under this Subsection     f  iv  B  may be combined with a nonsecure         placement.               v   Notwithstanding Subsection     u , no more than seven days of detention may be         ordered in combination with an order under Subsection     c  i .               g   The court may vest legal custody of an abused, neglected, or dependent minor in         the Division of Child and Family Services or any other appropriate person in accordance with         the requirements and procedures of Title   A, Chapter  , Part  , Abuse, Neglect, and         Dependency Proceedings.                h   The court may place a minor on a ranch or forestry camp, or similar facility for         care and also for work, if possible, if the person, agency, or association operating the facility         has been approved or has otherwise complied with all applicable state and local laws.  A minor         placed in a forestry camp or similar facility may be required to work on fire prevention,         forestation and reforestation, recreational works, forest roads, and on other works on or off the         grounds of the facility and may be paid wages, subject to the approval of and under conditions         set by the court.                h   i   If the court has reasonable suspicion of abuse, neglect, as defined in Section           A      , or dependency, the court may order the Division of Child and Family Services to         conduct an assessment to determine if provision of in home family preservation services, under         Section   A  a    , is appropriate.               ii   The court shall make and record findings of fact related to the court s reasonable         suspicion.               iii   If the assessment indicates a need for in home family preservation services under         Section   A  a    , the court, without filing a petition under Section   A      , may order                A   provision of in home family services for children adjudicated under Section           A       by the Division of Child and Family Services  and               B   participation of the child s parent or guardian in the in home family services.               i   i   The court may order a minor to repair, replace, or otherwise make restitution for          damage or  material loss caused by the minor s wrongful act , including costs of treatment as         stated in Section   A       and impose fines in limited amounts.  or for conduct for which the         minor agrees to make restitution.               ii   A victim has the meaning defined under Subsection      a        . A victim of an         offense that involves as an element a scheme, a conspiracy, or a pattern of criminal activity,         includes any person directly harmed by the minor s delinquency conduct in the course of the         scheme, conspiracy, or pattern.               iii   If the victim and the minor agree to participate, the court may refer the case to a         restorative justice program such as victim offender mediation to address how loss resulting         from the adjudicated act may be addressed.               iv   For the purpose of determining whether and how much restitution is appropriate,         the court shall consider the following                A   restitution shall only be ordered for the victim s material loss                B   restitution may not be ordered if there is evidence of the minor s inability to pay or         acquire the means to pay  and               C   any amount paid by the minor to the victim in civil penalty shall be credited against         restitution owed.               v   Any amount paid to the victim in restitution shall be credited against liability in a         civil suit.                ii    vi   The court may also require a minor to reimburse an individual, entity, or         governmental agency who offered and paid a reward to a person or persons for providing         information resulting in a court adjudication that the minor is within the jurisdiction of the         juvenile court due to the commission of a criminal offense.                iii    vii   If a minor is returned to this state under the Interstate Compact on Juveniles,         the court may order the minor to make restitution for costs expended by any governmental         entity for the return.               viii   The prosecutor shall submit a request for restitution to the court at the time of         disposition, if feasible, otherwise within three months after sentencing.               ix   A financial disposition ordered shall prioritize the payment of restitution.               j   The court may issue orders necessary for the collection of restitution and fines         ordered by the court, including garnishments, wage withholdings, and executions, except for an         order that changes the custody of the minor, including detention or other secure or nonsecure         residential placements.               k   i   The court may through its probation department encourage the development of         employment or work programs to enable minors to fulfill their obligations under Subsection             i  and for other purposes considered desirable by the court.               ii   Consistent with the order of the court, the probation officer may permit a minor         found to be within the jurisdiction of the court to participate in a nonresidential program of         work restitution or compensatory service in lieu of paying part or all of the fine imposed by the         court.               iii   The court may order the minor to                A   pay a fine, fee, restitution, or other cost  or               B   complete service hours.               iv   If the court orders a minor to pay a fine, fee, restitution, or other cost, or to         complete service hours, those dispositions shall be considered collectively to ensure that the         order is reasonable and prioritizes restitution.               v   If the court orders a minor to pay a fine, fee, or other cost, or complete service         hours, the cumulative order shall be limited per criminal episode as follows                A   for children under age    at adjudication, the court may impose up to      or up to            hours of service  and               B   for minors    and older at adjudication, the court may impose up to      or up to            hours of service.               vi   The cumulative order under Subsection     k  v  does not include restitution.               vii   If the court converts a fine, fee, or restitution amount to service hours, the rate of         conversion shall be no less than the minimum wage.               l   i   In violations of traffic laws within the court s jurisdiction, when the court finds         that as part of the commission of the violation the minor was in actual control of a motor         vehicle, the court may, in addition to any other disposition authorized by this section                A   restrain the minor from driving for periods of time the court considers necessary          and               B   take possession of the minor s driver license.               ii   The court may enter any other eligible disposition under Subsection     l  i  except         for a disposition under Subsection     c ,  d , or  f .  However, the suspension of driving         privileges for an offense under Section   A       is governed only by Section   A      .                m   i   When a minor is found within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under         Section   A       because of violating Section        , Title   , Chapter   a, Utah Drug         Paraphernalia Act, or Title   , Chapter   b, Imitation Controlled Substances Act, the court         shall, in addition to any fines or fees otherwise imposed, order that the minor perform a         minimum of    hours, but no more than     hours, of compensatory service.                m   i   The court may order a minor to complete community or compensatory service         hours in accordance with Subsections     k  iv  and  v .               ii   When community service is ordered, the presumptive service order shall include         between five and    hours of service.               iii   Satisfactory completion of an approved substance  abuse  use disorder prevention         or treatment program or other court approved condition may be credited by the court as         compensatory service hours.                ii   When a minor is found within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under Section           A       because of a violation of Section   B       or Subsection            , the court         may, upon the first adjudication, and shall, upon a second or subsequent adjudication, order         that the minor perform a minimum of    hours, but no more than     hours of compensatory         service, in addition to any fines or fees otherwise imposed.  Satisfactory completion of an         approved substance abuse prevention or treatment program may be credited by the court as         compensatory service hours.                 iii    iv   When a minor is found within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under         Section   A       because of a violation of Section          or          using graffiti, the         court may order the minor to clean up graffiti created by the minor or any other person at a time         and place within the jurisdiction of the court.  Compensatory service  required  ordered under         this section may be performed in the presence and under the direct supervision of the minor s         parent or legal guardian.  The parent or legal guardian shall report completion of the order to         the court.   The minor or the minor s parent or legal guardian, if applicable, shall be responsible         for removal costs as determined under Section         , unless waived by the court for good         cause.   The court may also require the minor to perform other alternative forms of restitution         or repair to the damaged property pursuant to  Subsection             Subsection     i .                A   For a first adjudication, the court may require the minor to clean up graffiti for not         less than eight hours.                 B   For a second adjudication, the court may require the minor to clean up graffiti for         not less than    hours.                 C   For a third adjudication, the court may require the minor to clean up graffiti for         not less than    hours.                n   i   Subject to Subsection     n  iii , the court may order that a minor                A   be examined or treated by a physician, surgeon, psychiatrist, or psychologist  or               B   receive other special care.               ii   For purposes of receiving the examination, treatment, or care described in         Subsection     n  i , the court may place the minor in a hospital or other suitable facility that is         not a secure facility or secure detention.               iii   In determining whether to order the examination, treatment, or care described in         Subsection     n  i , the court shall consider                A   the desires of the minor                B   if the minor is under the age of   , the desires of the parents or guardian of the         minor  and               C   whether the potential benefits of the examination, treatment, or care outweigh the         potential risks and side effects, including behavioral disturbances, suicidal ideation, brain         function impairment, or emotional or physical harm resulting from the compulsory nature of         the examination, treatment, or care.               iv   The Division of Child and Family Services shall take reasonable measures to         notify a parent or guardian of any non emergency health treatment or care scheduled for a         child, shall include the parent or guardian as fully as possible in making health care decisions         for the child, and shall defer to the parent s or guardian s reasonable and informed decisions         regarding the child s health care to the extent that the child s health and well being are not         unreasonably compromised by the parent s or guardian s decision.               v   The Division of Child and Family Services shall notify the parent or guardian of a         child within five business days after a child in the custody of the Division of Child and Family         Services receives emergency health care or treatment.               vi   The Division of Child and Family Services shall use the least restrictive means to         accomplish a compelling interest in the care and treatment of a child described in this         Subsection     n .               o   i   The court may appoint a guardian for the minor if it appears necessary in the         interest of the minor, and may appoint as guardian a public or private institution or agency, but         not a nonsecure residential placement provider, in which legal custody of the minor is vested.               ii   In placing a minor under the guardianship or legal custody of an individual or of a         private agency or institution, the court shall give primary consideration to the welfare of the         minor.  When practicable, the court may take into consideration the religious preferences of the         minor and of a child s parents.               p   i   In support of a decree under Section   A      , the court may order reasonable         conditions to be complied with by a minor s parents or guardian,  a minor,  a minor s custodian,         or any other person who has been made a party to the proceedings.  Conditions may include the         following if the conditions are based on the results of a validated risk and needs assessment                A   parent time by the parents or one parent                B   restrictions on the minor s associates                C   restrictions on the minor s occupation and other activities  and               D   requirements to be observed by the parents or custodian.               ii   A minor whose parents or guardians successfully complete a family or other         counseling program may be credited by the court for detention, confinement, or probation time.               q   The court may order the child to be committed to the physical custody of a local         mental health authority, in accordance with the procedures and requirements of Title   A,         Chapter   , Part  , Commitment of Persons Under Age    to Division of Substance Abuse and         Mental Health.               r   i   The court may make an order committing a minor within the court s jurisdiction         to the Utah State Developmental Center if the minor has an intellectual disability in accordance         with  the provisions of  Title   A, Chapter  , Part  , Admission to an Intermediate Care         Facility for People with an Intellectual Disability.               ii   The court shall follow the procedure applicable in the district courts with respect to         judicial commitments to the Utah State Developmental Center when ordering a commitment         under Subsection     r  i .               s   The court may terminate all parental rights upon a finding of compliance with  the         provisions of  Title   A, Chapter  , Part  , Termination of Parental Rights Act.               t   The court may make  any  other reasonable orders targeted toward reducing         reoffending that are for the best interest of the minor  or  and as required for the protection of         the public, except that a child may not be committed to jail  or , prison, secure detention, or the         custody of the Division of Juvenile Justice Services under Subsections     c  and  d . An order         that is inconsistent with the remaining provisions of this section is void.               u   The court may combine the dispositions listed in this section if it is permissible and         they are compatible.               v   Before depriving any parent of custody, the court shall give due consideration to the         rights of parents concerning their child.  The court may transfer custody of a minor to another         person, agency, or institution in accordance with the requirements and procedures of Title   A,         Chapter  , Part  , Abuse, Neglect, and Dependency Proceedings.               w   Except as provided in Subsection     y  i , an order under this section for         probation or placement of a minor with an individual or an agency shall include a date certain         for a review and presumptive termination of the case by the court in accordance with         Subsection     and Section   A      .

subsequent incident of abuse, neglect, or dependency         occurs involving the same substantiated abuser or under similar circumstance as the previous         abuse, that fact constitutes prima facie evidence that the child cannot safely remain in the         custody of the child s parent.               b   For purposes of Subsection     c                 i   another child residing in the

in the physical presence of the alleged abuser, that fact constitutes prima facie         evidence that the child is at substantial risk of being physically abused, sexually abused, or         sexually exploited.                   a   For purposes of Subsection    , if the division files a petition under Section           A      , the court shall consider the division s safety and risk assessments described in         Section   A  a    .  to determine whether a child should be removed from the custody of the         child s parent or guardian or should otherwise be taken into protective custody.               b   The division shall make a diligent effort to provide the safety and risk assessments         described in Section   A  a    .  to the court, guardian ad litem, and counsel for the parent or         guardian, as soon as practicable before the shelter hearing described in Section   A      .                   In the absence of one of the factors described in Subsection    , a court may not         remove a child from the parent s or guardian s custody on the basis of                a   educational neglect, truancy, or failure to comply with a court order to attend         school                b   mental illness or poverty of the parent or guardian  or               c   disability of the parent or guardian, as defined in Section        .

This section does not preclude removal of a child from the child s home without a         warrant or court order under Section   A  a    . .                   a   Except as provided in Subsection     b , a court or the Division of Child and         Family Services may not remove a child from the custody of the child s parent or guardian on         the sole or primary basis that the parent or guardian refuses to consent to                i   the administration of a psychotropic medication to a child                ii   a psychiatric, psychological, or behavioral treatment for a child  or               iii   a psychiatric or behavioral health evaluation of a child.               b   Notwithstanding Subsection     a , a court or the Division of Child and Family         Services may remove a child under conditions that would otherwise be prohibited under         Subsection     a  if failure to take an action described under Subsection     a  would present a         serious, imminent risk to the child s physical safety or the physical safety of others.

If the child is in the protective custody of the division, the division shall report to         the court                a   the reason why the child was removed from the parent s or guardian s custody                b   any services provided to the child and the child s family in an effort to prevent         removal                c   the need, if any, for continued shelter                d   the available services that could facilitate the return of the child to the custody of         the child s parent or guardian  and               e   subject to Subsections   A           c  through  e , whether any relatives of the         child or friends of the child s parents may be able and willing to accept temporary placement of         the child.                   The court shall consider all relevant evidence provided by persons or entities         authorized to present relevant evidence pursuant to this section.                   a   If necessary to protect

to provide the notice         described in Subsection     within the time described in Subsection    , the court may grant the         request of a parent or guardian for a continuance, not to exceed five judicial days.                   a   If the child is in the protective custody of the division, the court shall order that         the child be returned to the custody of the parent or guardian unless it finds, by a         preponderance of the evidence, consistent with the protections and requirements provided in         Subsection   A  a       , that any one of the following exists                i   subject to Subsection     b  i , there is a serious danger to the physical health or         safety of the child and the child s physical health or safety may not be protected without         removing the child from the custody of the child s parent                ii   A   the child is suffering emotional damage that results in a serious impairment in         the child s growth, development, behavior, or psychological functioning                B   the parent or guardian is unwilling or unable to make reasonable changes that         would sufficiently prevent future damage  and               C   there are no reasonable means available by which the child s emotional health may         be protected without removing the child from the custody of the child s parent or guardian                iii   there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer abuse or neglect if the child is         not removed from the custody of the child s parent or guardian                iv   subject to Subsection     b  ii , the child or a minor residing in the same         household has been, or is considered to be at substantial risk of being, physically abused,         sexually abused, or sexually exploited by a                A   parent or guardian                B   member of the parent s household or the guardian s household  or               C   person known to the parent or guardian                v   the parent or guardian is unwilling to have physical custody of the child                vi   the child is without any provision for the child s support                vii   a parent who is incarcerated or institutionalized has not or cannot arrange for safe         and appropriate care for the child                viii   A   a relative or other adult custodian with whom the child is left by the parent or         guardian is unwilling or unable to provide care or support for the child                B   the whereabouts of the parent or guardian are unknown  and               C   reasonable efforts to locate the parent or guardian are unsuccessful                ix   subject to Subsections   A                 d  and   A          n  and Section           A      . , the child is in immediate need of medical care                x   A   the physical environment or the fact that the child is left unattended beyond a         reasonable period of time poses a threat to the child s health or safety  and               B   the parent or guardian is unwilling or unable to make reasonable changes that         would remove the threat                xi   A   the child or a minor residing in the same household has been neglected  and               B   the parent or guardian is unwilling or unable to make reasonable changes that         would prevent the neglect                xii   the parent, guardian, or an adult residing in the same household as the parent or         guardian, is charged or arrested pursuant to Title   , Chapter   d, Clandestine Drug Lab Act,         and any clandestine laboratory operation was located in the residence or on the property where         the child resided                xiii   A   the child s welfare is substantially endangered  and               B   the parent or guardian is unwilling or unable to make reasonable changes that         would remove the danger  or               xiv   the child s natural parent                A   intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes the death of another parent of the         child                B   is identified by a law enforcement agency as the primary suspect in an investigation         for intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causing the death of another parent of the child  or               C   is being prosecuted for or has been convicted of intentionally, knowingly, or         recklessly causing the death of another parent of the child.               b   i   Prima facie evidence of the finding described in Subsection     a  i  is         established if                A   a court previously adjudicated that the child suffered abuse, neglect, or dependency         involving the parent  and               B   a subsequent incident of abuse, neglect, or dependency involving the parent occurs.               ii   For purposes of Subsection     a  iv , if the court finds that the parent knowingly         allowed the child to be in the physical care of a person after the parent received actual notice         that the person physically abused, sexually abused, or sexually exploited the child, that fact         constitutes prima facie evidence that there is a substantial risk that the child will be physically         abused, sexually abused, or sexually exploited.                    a   i   The court shall also make a determination on the record as to whether         reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from the         child s home and whether there are available services that would prevent the need for continued         removal.               ii   If the court finds that the child can be safely returned to the custody of the child s         parent or guardian through the provision of those services, the court shall place the child with         the child s parent or guardian and order that those services be provided by the division.               b   In making the determination described in Subsection      a , and in ordering and         providing services, the child s health, safety, and welfare shall be the paramount concern, in         accordance with federal law.                    Where the division s first contact with the family occurred during an emergency         situation in which the child could not safely remain at home, the court shall make a finding that         any lack of preplacement preventive efforts was appropriate.                    In cases where actual sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abandonment, severe         abuse, or severe neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make          reasonable efforts  or to, in any other way, attempt to maintain a child in the child s home,         return a child to the child s home, provide reunification services, or attempt to rehabilitate the         offending parent or parents.                    The court may not order continued removal of a child solely on the basis of         educational neglect as described in Subsection   A                 b , truancy, or failure to         comply with a court order to attend school.                    a   Whenever a court orders continued removal of a child under this section, the         court shall state the facts on which that decision is based.               b   If no continued removal is ordered and the child is returned home, the court shall         state the facts on which that decision is based.                    If the court finds that continued removal and temporary custody are necessary for         the protection of a child pursuant to Subsection     a , the court shall order continued removal         regardless of                a   any error in the initial removal of the child                b   the failure of a party to comply with notice provisions  or               c   any other procedural requirement of this chapter or Title   A, Chapter  a, Child         and Family Services.              Section   .  Section   A       is amended to read                 A      . Dispositional hearing    Reunification services    Exceptions.                   The court may                a   make any of the dispositions described in Section   A                      b   place the minor in the custody or guardianship of any                i   individual  or               ii   public or private entity or agency  or               c   order                i   protective supervision                ii   family preservation                iii   subject to Subsections      b ,   A                 d , and   A          n  and         Section   A      . , medical or mental health treatment  or               iv   other services.                   Whenever the court orders continued removal at the dispositional hearing, and that         the minor remain in the custody of the division, the court shall first                a   establish a primary permanency plan for the minor  and               b   determine whether, in view of the primary permanency plan, reunification services         are appropriate for the minor and the minor s family, pursuant to Subsections      through     .                   Subject to Subsections     and    , if the court determines that reunification         services are appropriate for the minor and the minor s family, the court shall provide for         reasonable parent time with the parent or parents from whose custody the minor was removed,         unless parent time is not in the best interest of the minor.                   In cases where obvious sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abandonment, severe         abuse, or severe neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make          reasonable efforts  or to, in any other way, attempt to provide reunification services, or to         attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.                   In all cases, the minor s health, safety, and welfare shall be the court s paramount         concern in determining whether reasonable efforts to reunify should be made.                   For purposes of Subsection    , parent time is in the best interests of a minor unless         the court makes a finding that it is necessary to deny parent time in order to                a   protect the physical safety of the minor                b   protect the life of the minor  or               c   prevent the minor from being traumatized by contact with the parent due to the         minor s fear of the parent in light of the nature of the alleged abuse or neglect.                   Notwithstanding Subsection    , a court may not deny parent time based solely on a         parent s failure to                a   prove that the parent has not used legal or illegal substances  or               b   comply with an aspect of the child and family plan that is ordered by the court.                   a   In addition to the primary permanency plan, the court shall establish a         concurrent permanency plan that shall include                i   a representative list of the conditions under which the primary permanency plan will         be abandoned in favor of the concurrent permanency plan  and               ii   an explanation of the effect of abandoning or modifying the primary permanency         plan.               b   In determining the primary permanency plan and concurrent permanency plan, the         court shall consider                i   the preference for kinship placement over nonkinship placement                ii   the potential for a guardianship placement if the parent child relationship is legally         terminated and no appropriate adoption placement is available  and               iii   the use of an individualized permanency plan, only as a last resort.                   A permanency hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Subsection           A          b  within    days after the day on which the dispositional hearing ends if         something other than reunification is initially established as a minor s primary permanency         plan.                    a   The court may amend a minor s primary permanency plan before the         establishment of a final permanency plan under Section   A      .               b   The court is not limited to the terms of the concurrent permanency plan in the event         that the primary permanency plan is abandoned.               c   If, at any time, the court determines that reunification is no longer a minor s primary         permanency plan, the court shall conduct a permanency hearing in accordance with Section           A       on or before the earlier of                i      days after the day on which the court makes the determination described in this         Subsection      c   or               ii   the day on which the provision of reunification services, described in Section           A      , ends.                    a   If the court determines that reunification services are appropriate,  it  the court         shall order that the division make reasonable efforts to provide services to the minor and the         minor s parent for the purpose of facilitating reunification of the family, for a specified period         of time.               b   In providing the services described in Subsection      a , the minor s health, safety,         and welfare shall be the division s paramount concern, and the court shall so order.                    a   The court shall                i   determine whether the services offered or provided by the division under the child         and family plan constitute  reasonable efforts  on the part of the division                ii   determine and define the responsibilities of the parent under the child and family         plan in accordance with Subsection   A  a        e   and               iii   identify verbally on the record, or in a written document provided to the parties,         the responsibilities described in Subsection      a  ii , for the purpose of assisting in any future         determination regarding the provision of reasonable efforts, in accordance with state and         federal law.               b   If the parent is in a substance  abuse  use disorder treatment program, other than a         certified drug court program                i   the court may order the parent to submit to supplementary drug or alcohol testing in         addition to the testing recommended by the parent s substance  abuse  use disorder program         based on a finding of reasonable suspicion that the parent is abusing drugs or alcohol  and               ii   the court may order the parent to provide the results of drug or alcohol testing         recommended by the substance  abuse  use disorder program to the court or division.                    a   The time period for reunification services may not exceed    months from the         date that the minor was initially removed from the minor s home, unless the time period is         extended under Subsection   A         .               b   Nothing in this section may be construed to entitle any parent to an entire            months of reunification services.                    a   If reunification services are ordered, the court may terminate those services at         any time.               b   If, at any time, continuation of reasonable efforts to reunify a minor is determined         to be inconsistent with the final permanency plan for the minor established pursuant to Section           A      , then measures shall be taken, in a timely manner, to                i   place the minor in accordance with the permanency plan  and               ii   complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the         minor.                    Any physical custody of the minor by the parent or a relative during the period         described in Subsections      through      does not interrupt the running of the period.                    a   If reunification services are ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted         by the court in accordance with Section   A       at the expiration of the time period for         reunification services.               b   The permanency hearing shall be held no later than    months after the original         removal of the minor.               c   If reunification services are not ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted         within    days, in accordance with Section   A      .                    With regard to a minor in the custody of the division whose parent or parents are         ordered to receive reunification services but who have abandoned that minor for a period of six         months from the date that reunification services were ordered                a   the court shall terminate reunification services  and               b   the division shall petition the court for termination of parental rights.                    When a court conducts a permanency hearing for a minor under Section           A      , the court shall attempt to keep the minor s sibling group together if keeping the         sibling group together is                a   practicable  and               b   in accordance with the best interest of the minor.                    a   Because of the state s interest in and responsibility to protect and provide         permanency for minors who are abused, neglected, or dependent, the Legislature finds that a         parent s interest in receiving reunification services is limited.               b   The court may determine that                i   efforts to reunify a minor with the minor s family are not reasonable or appropriate,         based on the individual circumstances  and               ii   reunification services should not be provided.               c   In determining  reasonable efforts  to be made with respect to a minor, and in         making  reasonable efforts,  the minor s health, safety, and welfare shall be the paramount         concern.                    There is a presumption that reunification services should not be provided to a         parent if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that any of the following         circumstances exist                a   the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, based upon a verified affidavit         indicating that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent                b   subject to Subsection      a , the parent is suffering from a mental illness of such         magnitude that it renders the parent incapable of utilizing reunification services                c   the minor was previously adjudicated as an abused child due to physical abuse,         sexual abuse, or sexual exploitation, and following the adjudication the minor                i   was removed from the custody of the minor s parent                ii   was subsequently returned to the custody of the parent  and               iii   is being removed due to additional physical abuse, sexual abuse, or sexual         exploitation                d   the parent                i   caused the death of another minor through abuse or neglect                ii   committed, aided, abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to commit                A   murder or manslaughter of a child  or               B   child abuse homicide                iii   committed sexual abuse against the child                iv   is a registered sex offender or required to register as a sex offender  or               v   A   intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes the death of another parent of the         child                B   is identified by a law enforcement agency as the primary suspect in an investigation         for intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causing the death of another parent of the child  or               C   is being prosecuted for or has been convicted of intentionally, knowingly, or         recklessly causing the death of another parent of the child                e   the minor suffered severe abuse by the parent or by any person known by the         parent, if the parent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was abusing the         minor                f   the minor is adjudicated an abused child as a result of severe abuse by the parent,         and the court finds that it would not benefit the minor to pursue reunification services with the         offending parent                g   the parent s rights are terminated with regard to any other minor                h   the minor was removed from the minor s home on at least two previous occasions         and reunification services were offered or provided to the family at those times                i   the parent has abandoned the minor for a period of six months or longer                j   the parent permitted the child to reside, on a permanent or temporary basis, at a         location where the parent knew or should have known that a clandestine laboratory operation         was located                k   except as provided in Subsection      b , with respect to a parent who is the child s         birth mother, the child has fetal alcohol syndrome, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, or was         exposed to an illegal or prescription drug that was abused by the child s mother while the child         was in utero, if the child was taken into division custody for that reason, unless the mother         agrees to enroll in, is currently enrolled in, or has recently and successfully completed a         substance  abuse  use disorder treatment program approved by the department  or               l   any other circumstance that the court determines should preclude reunification         efforts or services.                    a   The finding under Subsection      b  shall be based on competent evidence         from at least two medical or mental health professionals, who are not associates, establishing         that, even with the provision of services, the parent is not likely to be capable of adequately         caring for the minor within    months after the day on which the court finding is made.               b   A judge may disregard the provisions of Subsection      k  if the court finds, under         the circumstances of the case, that the substance  abuse  use disorder treatment described in         Subsection      k  is not warranted.                    In determining whether reunification services are appropriate, the court shall take         into consideration                a   failure of the parent to respond to previous services or comply with a previous child         and family plan                b   the fact that the minor was abused while the parent was under the influence of         drugs or alcohol                c   any history of violent behavior directed at the child or an immediate family         member                d   whether a parent continues to live with an individual who abused the minor                e   any patterns of the parent s behavior that have exposed the minor to repeated abuse                f   testimony by a competent professional that the parent s behavior is unlikely to be         successful  and               g   whether the parent has expressed an interest in reunification with the minor.                    a   If reunification services are not ordered pursuant to Subsections      through             , and the whereabouts of a parent become known within six months after the day on which         the out of home placement of the minor is made, the court may order the division to provide         reunification services.               b   The time limits described in Subsections     through      are not tolled by the         parent s absence.                    a   If a parent is incarcerated or institutionalized, the court shall order reasonable         services unless  it  the court determines that those services would be detrimental to the minor.               b   In making the determination described in Subsection      a , the court shall         consider                i   the age of the minor                ii   the degree of parent child bonding                iii   the length of the sentence                iv   the nature of the treatment                v   the nature of the crime or illness                vi   the degree of detriment to the minor if services are not offered                vii   for a minor    years old or older, the minor s attitude toward the implementation         of family reunification services  and               viii   any other appropriate factors.               c   Reunification services for an incarcerated parent are subject to the time limitations         imposed in Subsections     through     .               d   Reunification services for an institutionalized parent are subject to the time         limitations imposed in Subsections     through     , unless the court determines that continued         reunification services would be in the minor s best interest.

A youth court may not accept referrals from law enforcement, schools, prosecuting         attorneys, or a juvenile court unless the youth court is certified by the Utah Youth Court Board.                   Any person may refer youth to a youth court for minor offenses or for any other         eligible offense under Section   A       .

Except with permission granted under Subsection    , or pursuant to Section           A       , youth courts may not exercise authority over youth who are under the continuing         jurisdiction of the juvenile court for law violations, including any youth who may have a matter         pending which has not yet been adjudicated.  Youth courts may, however, exercise authority         over youth who are under the continuing jurisdiction of the juvenile court as set forth in this         Subsection     if the offense before the youth court is not a law violation, and the referring         agency has notified the juvenile court of the referral.                   Youth courts may exercise authority over youth described in Subsection    , and         over any other offense with the permission of the juvenile court and the prosecuting attorney in         the county or district that would have jurisdiction if the matter were referred to juvenile court.

The youth court may transfer a case back to the referring source for         alternative handling at any time.                           Referral of a case to youth court may not, if otherwise eligible, prohibit the         subsequent referral of the case to any court.                           Proceedings and dispositions of a youth court may only be shared with the         referring agency, juvenile court, and victim.

This fee may be reduced or waived by the youth court in exigent         circumstances and shall be based on the ability of the minor s family to pay as determined by a         statewide sliding scale developed by the Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice as         provided in Section   M      .  This fee shall be paid to and accounted for by the sponsoring         entity.  The fees collected shall be used for supplies and any training requirements.                   Youth court participants are responsible for the all expenses of any classes,         counseling, treatment, or other educational programs that are the disposition of the youth court.                   Youth court participants may not be terminated unsuccessfully from youth court         due to failure to pay related fees or expenses.              Section   .

If a motion for inquiry is opposed by either party, the court shall, prior to granting         or denying the motion, hold a limited hearing solely for the purpose of determining the         sufficiency of the motion.  If the court finds that the allegations of incompetency raise a bona         fide doubt as to the minor s competency to proceed, it shall enter an order for an evaluation of         the minor s competency to proceed, and shall set a date for a hearing on the issue of the minor s         competency.                   After the granting of a motion, and prior to a full competency hearing, the court         may order the Department of Human Services to evaluate the minor and to report to the court         concerning the minor s mental condition.                   The minor shall be evaluated by a mental health examiner with experience in         juvenile forensic evaluations and juvenile brain development, who is not involved in the         current treatment of the minor.  If it becomes apparent that the minor may be not competent         due to an intellectual disability or related condition, the examiner shall be experienced in         intellectual disability or related condition evaluations of minors.                   The petitioner or other party, as directed by the court, shall provide all information         and materials to the examiners relevant to a determination of the minor s competency         including                a   the motion                b   the arrest or incident reports pertaining to the charged offense                c   the minor s known delinquency history information                d   known prior mental health evaluations and treatments  and               e   consistent with    U.S.C.

The examiner shall provide an initial report to the court, the prosecuting and         defense attorneys, and the guardian ad litem, if applicable, within    days of the receipt of the         court s order.  If the examiner informs the court that additional time is needed, the court may         grant, taking into consideration the custody status of the minor, up to an additional    days to         provide the report to the court and counsel.  The examiner must provide the report within            days from the receipt of the court s order unless, for good cause shown, the court authorizes an         additional period of time to complete the evaluation and provide the report.  The report shall         inform the court of the examiner s opinion concerning the competency and the likelihood of the         minor to attain competency within a year.  In the alternative, the examiner may inform the court         in writing that additional time is needed to complete the report.                    Any statement made by the minor in the course of any competency evaluation,         whether the evaluation is with or without the consent of the minor, any testimony by the         examiner based upon any statement, and any other fruits of the statement may not be admitted         in evidence against the minor in any delinquency or criminal proceeding except on an issue         respecting the mental condition on which the minor has introduced evidence.  The evidence         may be admitted, however, where relevant to a determination of the minor s competency.

A minor shall be presumed competent unless the court, by a preponderance of the         evidence, finds the minor not competent to proceed.  The burden of proof is upon the         proponent of incompetency to proceed.                    a   Following the hearing, the court shall determine by a preponderance of         evidence whether the minor is                i   competent to proceed                ii   not competent to proceed with a substantial probability that the minor may attain         competency in the foreseeable future  or               iii   not competent to proceed without a substantial probability that the minor may         attain competency in the foreseeable future.               b   If the court enters a finding pursuant to Subsection      a  i , the court shall         proceed with the delinquency proceedings.               c   If the court enters a finding pursuant to Subsection      a  ii , the court shall         proceed consistent with Section   A       .               d   If the court enters a finding pursuant to Subsection      a  iii , the court shall         terminate the competency proceeding, dismiss the delinquency charges without prejudice, and         release the minor from any custody order related to the pending delinquency proceeding, unless         the prosecutor informs the court that commitment proceedings pursuant to Title   A, Chapter          , Services for People with Disabilities, or Title   A, Chapter   , Substance Abuse and Mental         Health Act, will be initiated.

A justice court judge may transfer a criminal matter in which the defendant is a         child to the juvenile court for further proceedings if the justice court judge determines and the         juvenile court concurs that the best interests of the minor would be served by the continuing         jurisdiction of the juvenile court, subject to Section   A      .                   Justice courts have jurisdiction of small claims cases under Title   A, Chapter  ,         Small Claims Courts, if a defendant resides in or the debt arose within the territorial         jurisdiction of the justice court.Legislative Review NoteOffice of Legislative Research and General Counsel
