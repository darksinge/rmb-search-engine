Hawkes      Senate Sponsor    Margaret Dayton             LONG TITLE      General Description            This bill modifies provisions regarding a nonuse application.       Highlighted Provisions             This bill                   states that an approved nonuse application excuses the requirement of beneficial use       of water from the date of filing                   states that the time during which an approved nonuse application is in effect does       not count toward the seven year time limit for purposes of forfeiture                   states that the filing or approval of a nonuse application or a series of nonuse       applications does not                        constitute a beneficial use of a water right                        protect a water right that is already subject to forfeiture  and                       bar a water right owner from using the water under the water right, as permitted       under the water right, or claiming a forfeiture defense                   modifies the procedure for instituting a forfeiture action  and                  makes technical changes.

As used in this section              a    Public entity  means              i   the United States              ii   an agency of the United States              iii   the state              iv   a state agency              v   a political subdivision of the state  or             vi   an agency of a political subdivision of the state.             b    Public water supplier  means an entity that              i   supplies water, directly or indirectly, to the public for municipal, domestic, or       industrial use  and             ii   is              A   a public entity              B   a water corporation, as defined in Section       , that is regulated by the Public       Service Commission              C   a community water system              I   that              Aa   supplies water to at least     service connections used by year round residents  or             Bb   regularly serves at least     year round residents  and             II   whose voting members              Aa   own a share in the community water system              Bb   receive water from the community water system in proportion to the member s       share in the community water system  and             Cc   pay the rate set by the community water system based on the water the member       receives  or             D   a water users association              I   in which one or more public entities own at least     of the outstanding shares  and             II   that is a local sponsor of a water project constructed by the United States Bureau of       Reclamation.             c    Shareholder  means the same as that term is defined in Section       . .             d    Water company  means the same as that term is defined in Section       . .             e    Water supply entity  means an entity that supplies water as a utility service or for       irrigation purposes and is also              i   a municipality, water conservancy district, metropolitan water district, irrigation       district, or other public agency              ii   a water company regulated by the Public Service Commission  or             iii   any other owner of a community water system.                 a   Except as provided in Subsection     b  or  e , when an appropriator or the       appropriator s successor in interest abandons or ceases to beneficially use all or a portion of a       water right for a period of at least seven years, the water right or the unused portion of that       water right is subject to forfeiture in accordance with Subsection     c .             b   i   An appropriator or the appropriator s successor in interest may file an       application for nonuse with the state engineer.              ii   If a person described in Subsection     b  i  files and receives approval on a       nonuse application, nonuse of the water right subject to the application is not counted toward a       seven year period described in Subsection     a  during the period of time beginning on the day       on which the person files the application and ending on the day on which the application       expires without being renewed.               iii   If a person described in Subsection     b  i  files and receives approval on       successive, overlapping nonuse applications, nonuse of the water right subject to the       applications is not counted toward a seven year period described in Subsection     a  during       the period of time beginning on the day on which the person files the first application and       ending on the day on which the last application expires without being renewed.               iv   Approval of one or more nonuse applications, or successive overlapping nonuse       applications, does not protect a water right that is already subject to forfeiture under Subsection           a  for full or partial nonuse of the water right, nor does the approval of one or more nonuse       applications constitute beneficial use of the water for purposes of calculating the    year period       in Subsection     c  i .               v    ii   A nonuse application may be filed on all or a portion of the water right,       including water rights held by a water company.              vi    iii   After giving written notice to the water company, a shareholder may file a       nonuse application with the state engineer on the water represented by the stock.             iv   A   The approval of a nonuse application excuses the requirement of beneficial use        of water from the date of filing.              B   The time during which an approved nonuse application is in effect does not count        toward the seven year period described in Subsection     a .              v   The filing or approval of a nonuse application or a series of nonuse applications        under Subsection     does not               A   constitute beneficial use of a water right               B   protect a water right that is already subject to forfeiture under this section  or              C   bar a water right owner from               I   using the water under the water right as permitted under the water right  or              II   claiming the benefit of Subsection     e  or any other forfeiture defense provided        by law.              c   i   Except as provided in Subsection     c  ii , a water right or a portion of the        water right may not be forfeited unless a judicial action to declare the right forfeited is        commenced               A   within    years from the end of the latest period of nonuse of at least seven        years .   or              B   within the combined time of    years from the end of the most recent period of        nonuse of at least seven years and the time the water right was subject to one or more nonuse        applications.              ii   A   The state engineer, in a proposed determination of rights filed with the court        and prepared in accordance with Section        , may not assert that a water right was        forfeited unless  a  the most recent period of nonuse of seven years ends or occurs               I   during the    years immediately preceding the day on which the state engineer files        the proposed determination of rights with the court .   or              II   during the combined time immediately preceding the day on which the state        engineer files the proposed determination of rights consisting of    years and the time the        water right was subject to one or more approved nonuse applications.              B   After the day on which a proposed determination of rights is filed with the court a        person may not assert that a water right subject to that determination was forfeited  during the           year period described in Subsection     c  ii  A ,  before the issuance of the proposed        determination, unless the state engineer asserts forfeiture in the proposed determination, or a        person  makes , in accordance with Section        , makes an objection to the proposed        determination that asserts forfeiture.              iii   A water right, found to be valid in a decree entered in an action for general        determination of rights under Chapter  , Determination of Water Rights, is subject to a claim        of forfeiture based on a seven year period of nonuse that begins after the day on which the state        engineer filed the related proposed determination of rights with the court, unless the decree        provides otherwise.              iv   If in a judicial action a court declares a water right forfeited, on the date on which        the water right is forfeited               A   the right to beneficially use the water reverts to the public  and              B   the water made available by the forfeiture               I   first, satisfies other water rights in the hydrologic system in order of priority date         and              II   second, may be appropriated as provided in this title.              d   Except as provided in Subsection     e , this section applies whether the unused or        abandoned water or a portion of the water is               i   permitted to run to waste  or              ii   beneficially used by others without right with the knowledge of the water right        holder.              e   This section does not apply to               i   the beneficial use of water according to a lease or other agreement with the        appropriator or the appropriator s successor in interest               ii   a water right if its place of use is contracted under an approved state agreement or        federal conservation fallowing program               iii   those periods of time when a surface water or groundwater source fails to yield        sufficient water to satisfy the water right               iv   a water right when water is unavailable because of the water right s priority date               v   a water right to store water in a surface reservoir or an aquifer, in accordance with        Title   , Chapter  b, Groundwater Recharge and Recovery Act, if               A   the water is stored for present or future beneficial use  or              B   storage is limited by a safety, regulatory, or engineering restraint that the        appropriator or the appropriator s successor in interest cannot reasonably correct               vi   a water right if a water user has beneficially used substantially all of the water right        within a seven year period, provided that this exemption does not apply to the adjudication of a        water right in a general determination of water rights under Chapter  , Determination of Water        Rights               vii   except as provided by Subsection     g , a water right               A   I   owned by a public water supplier               II   represented by a public water supplier s ownership interest in a water company  or              III   to which a public water supplier owns the right of beneficial use  and              B   conserved or held for the reasonable future water requirement of the public, which        is determined according to Subsection     f                viii   a supplemental water right during a period of time when another water right        available to the appropriator or the appropriator s successor in interest provides sufficient water        so as to not require beneficial use of the supplemental water right  or              ix   a period of nonuse of a water right during the time the water right is subject to an        approved change application where the applicant is diligently pursuing certification.              f   i   The reasonable future water requirement of the public is the amount of water        needed in the next    years by               A   the persons within the public water supplier s reasonably anticipated service area        based on reasonably anticipated population growth  or              B   other water use demand.              ii   For purposes of Subsection     f  i , a community water system s reasonably        anticipated service area               A   is the area served by the community water system s distribution facilities  and              B   expands as the community water system expands the distribution facilities in        accordance with Title   , Chapter  , Safe Drinking Water Act.              g   For a water right acquired by a public water supplier on or after May  ,     ,        Subsection     e  vii  applies if               i   the public water supplier submits a change application under Section         and              ii   the state engineer approves the change application.                  a   The state engineer shall furnish a nonuse application form requiring the        following information               i   the name and address of the applicant               ii   a description of the water right or a portion of the water right, including the point of        diversion, place of use, and priority               iii   the quantity of water               iv   the period of use               v   the extension of time applied for               vi   a statement of the reason for the nonuse of the water  and              vii   any other information that the state engineer requires.              b   i   Upon receipt of the application, the state engineer shall publish a notice of the        application once a week for two successive weeks               A   in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the source of the water        supply is located and where the water is to be beneficially used  and              B   as required in Section         .              ii   The notice shall               A   state that an application has been made  and              B   specify where the interested party may obtain additional information relating to the        application.              c   Any interested person may file a written protest with the state engineer against the        granting of the application               i   within    days after the notice is published, if the adjudicative proceeding is        informal  and              ii   within    days after the notice is published, if the adjudicative proceeding is        formal.              d   In any proceedings to determine whether the nonuse application should be        approved or rejected, the state engineer shall follow the procedures and requirements of Title          G, Chapter  , Administrative Procedures Act.              e   After further investigation, the state engineer may approve or reject the application.                  a   The state engineer shall grant a nonuse application on all or a portion of a water        right for a period of time not exceeding seven years if the applicant shows a reasonable cause        for nonuse.              b   A reasonable cause for nonuse includes               i   a demonstrable financial hardship or economic depression               ii   physical causes or changes that render use beyond the reasonable control of the        water right owner so long as the water right owner acts with reasonable diligence to resume or        restore the use               iii   the initiation of water conservation or efficiency practices, or the operation of a        groundwater recharge recovery program approved by the state engineer               iv   operation of legal proceedings               v   the holding of a water right or stock in a mutual water company without use by any        water supply entity to meet the reasonable future requirements of the public               vi   situations where, in the opinion of the state engineer, the nonuse would assist in        implementing an existing, approved water management plan  or              vii   the loss of capacity caused by deterioration of the water supply or delivery        equipment if the applicant submits, with the application, a specific plan to resume full use of        the water right by replacing, restoring, or improving the equipment.                  a   Sixty days before the expiration of a nonuse application, the state engineer shall        notify the applicant by mail or by any form of electronic communication through which receipt        is verifiable, of the date when the nonuse application will expire.              b   An applicant may file a subsequent nonuse application in accordance with this        section.             Section  .  Section       .  is amended to read                    . . Authorization for water companies to allocate water rights lost by        forfeiture or nonuse    Redemption and retirement of water shares.                  a   If a water right, to which a  mutual  water company holds title, ceases or is lost        due to forfeiture or abandonment for lack of beneficial use, in whole or in part, the water        company shall, through procedures consistent with this section, and as defined in the        company s articles of incorporation or bylaws, apportion the loss to each stockholder whose        failure to make beneficial use caused the loss of the water right.              b   The water company shall make an apportionment if  the Utah Division of Water        Rights or  a court of proper jurisdiction makes a final decision that a loss has occurred.              c   The water company shall also reduce the amount of water provided to the        shareholder in proportion to the amount of the lost water right during an appeal of a decision        that reduced the company water rights, unless otherwise ordered by a court of proper        jurisdiction.              d   The water company may take any action under this Subsection    , whether the loss        occurred               i   under Utah Code Annotated Section       , including losses that occur as part of a        general determination under Title   , Chapter  , Determination of Water Rights  or              ii   through any other decision by a court of proper jurisdiction.                  a   If the water company apportions a water right under Subsection    , a sufficient        number of shares to account for the water right lost, including necessary transport or  carrier        water  losses, shall be treated by the water company as shares redeemed by the company from        the stockholder responsible for the loss.              b   The number of shares owned by that shareholder shall be reduced accordingly on        the records of the company.              c   Upon the redemption, the authorized shares of the company shall be reduced by the        amount of shares that were redeemed under this Subsection    .                  The redemption and retirement under this section of shares belonging to a        stockholder does not relieve the stockholder of liability for unpaid assessments on the stock or        debts the shareholder may owe to the water company.Legislative Review NoteOffice of Legislative Research and General Counsel
