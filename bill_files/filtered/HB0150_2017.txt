Section         is amended to read                    . Custody of children in case of separation or divorce    Custody       consideration.                 If a  husband and wife having  married couple having one or more minor children       are separated, or their marriage is declared void or dissolved, the court shall make an order for       the future care and custody of the minor children as it considers appropriate.             a   In determining any form of custody, including a change in custody, the court shall       consider the best interests of the child without preference for either  the mother or father        parent solely because of the biological sex of the parent and, among other factors the court       finds relevant, the following              i   the past conduct and demonstrated moral standards of each of the parties              ii   which parent is most likely to act in the best interest of the child, including       allowing the child frequent and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent              iii   the extent of bonding between the parent and child, meaning the depth, quality,       and nature of the relationship between a parent and child              iv   whether the parent has intentionally exposed the child to pornography or material       harmful to a minor, as defined in Section             and             v   those factors outlined in Section        . .             b   There  shall be  is a rebuttable presumption that joint legal custody, as defined in       Section        . , is in the best interest of the child, except in cases where there is              i   domestic violence in the home or in the presence of the child              ii   special physical or mental needs of a parent or child, making joint legal custody       unreasonable              iii   physical distance between the residences of the parents, making joint decision       making impractical in certain circumstances  or             iv   any other factor the court considers relevant including those listed in this section       and Section        . .             c   The person who desires joint legal custody shall file a proposed parenting plan in       accordance with Sections        .  and        . .  A presumption for joint legal custody may       be rebutted by a showing by a preponderance of the evidence that it is not in the best interest of       the child.             d    The children  A child may not be required by either party to testify unless the trier       of fact determines that extenuating circumstances exist that would necessitate the testimony of       the  children  child be heard and there is no other reasonable method to present  their  the       child s testimony.             e   The court may inquire of  the children  a child and take into consideration the        children s  child s desires regarding future custody or parent time schedules, but the expressed       desires are not controlling and the court may determine the  children s  child s custody or       parent time otherwise.  The desires of a child    years of age or older shall be given added       weight, but is not the single controlling factor.             f    If interviews with the children are  If an interview with a child is conducted by the       court pursuant to Subsection     e ,  they  the interview shall be conducted by the judge in       camera.  The prior consent of the parties may be obtained but is not necessary if the court finds       that an interview with  the children  a child is the only method to ascertain the child s desires       regarding custody.                 In awarding custody, the court shall consider, among other factors the court finds       relevant, which parent is most likely to act in the best interests of the child, including allowing       the child frequent and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent as the court finds       appropriate.                 If the court finds that one parent does not desire custody of the child, the court shall       take that evidence into consideration in determining whether to award custody to the other       parent.                 a   Except as provided in Subsection     b , a court may not discriminate against a       parent due to a disability, as defined in Section        , in awarding custody or determining       whether a substantial change has occurred for the purpose of modifying an award of custody.              b   If a court takes a parent s disability into account in awarding custody or       determining whether a substantial change has occurred for the purpose of modifying an award       of custody, the parent with a disability may rebut any evidence, presumption, or inference       arising from the disability by showing that               b   The court may not consider the disability of a parent as a factor in awarding       custody, unless the court makes specific findings that              i   the disability  does not  significantly or substantially  inhibit  inhibits the parent s       ability to provide for the physical and emotional needs of the child at issue   or  and             ii   the parent with a disability  has  lacks sufficient human, monetary, or other       resources available to supplement the parent s ability to provide for the physical and emotional       needs of the child at issue.             c   Nothing in this section may be construed to apply to adoption proceedings under       Title   B, Chapter  , Part  , Utah Adoption Act.                 This section establishes neither a preference nor a presumption for or against joint       physical custody or sole physical custody, but allows the court and the family the widest       discretion to choose a parenting plan that is in the best interest of the child.Legislative Review NoteOffice of Legislative Research and General Counsel
