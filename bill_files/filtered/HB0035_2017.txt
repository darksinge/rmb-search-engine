The average daily membership of the child may be added to that of other eligible       children attending schools within the district of residence for the purpose of apportionment of       state funds.                 a   The district of residence shall bear any excess tuition costs over the state s       contribution for attendance in the district of residence unless otherwise approved in advance by       the State Board of Education.             b   i   If a child who resides in a Utah school district s boundaries attends school in a       neighboring state under this section, the State Board of Education may make an out of state       tuition payment to the Utah school district of residence.             ii   If the State Board of Education approves the use of state funds for an out of state       tuition payment described in Subsection     b  i , the State Board of Education shall use funds       appropriated by the Legislature for necessarily existent small schools as described in Section         A   a    .

The board shall adopt standards and make rules to              a   govern the approval of necessarily existent small schools consistent with principles       of efficiency and economy and which shall serve the purpose of eliminating schools where       consolidation is feasible by participation in special school units  and             b   ensure that districts are not building secondary schools in close proximity to one       another where economy and efficiency would be better served by one school meeting the needs       of secondary students in a designated geographical area.                 A one or two year secondary school that has received necessarily existent small       school money under this section prior to July  ,     , may continue to receive such money in       subsequent years under board rule.                 The board shall prepare and publish objective standards and guidelines for       determining which small schools are necessarily existent after consultation with local school       boards.                 a   Additional weighted pupil units for schools classified as necessarily existent       small schools shall be computed using regression formulas adopted by the board.             b   The regression formulas establish the following maximum sizes for funding under       the necessarily existent small school program              i   an elementary school                                    ii   a one or two year secondary school                          iii   a three year secondary school                               iv   a four year secondary school                               v   a six year secondary school                               c   Schools with fewer than    students shall receive the same add on weighted pupil       units as schools with    students.             d   The board shall prepare and distribute an allocation table based on the regression       formula to each school district.                 a   To avoid penalizing a district financially for consolidating its small schools,       additional weighted pupil units may be allowed a district each year, not to exceed two years.             b   The additional weighted pupil units may not exceed the difference between what       the district receives for a consolidated school and what it would have received for the small       schools had they not been consolidated.                 Subject to legislative appropriation, the board shall give first priority from an       appropriation made under this section to funding an expense approved by the board as       described in Subsection   A          a .                        a   Subject to Subsection           b  and after a distribution made under        Subsection    , the board may distribute a portion of necessarily existent small schools funding        in accordance with a formula adopted by the board that considers the tax effort of a local        school board.              b   The amount distributed in accordance with Subsection           a  may not exceed        the necessarily existent small schools fund in balance of the prior fiscal year.
