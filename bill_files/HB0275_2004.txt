273

    
    (c)  Upon the request of the petitioner, the court may waive the postplacement adoptive

279

    
placement, either in the preplacement or postplacement adoptive evaluation, the court may

    (ii)  The subjective intent of an unmarried, biological father, whether expressed or
            
399

    
otherwise, unsupported by evidence of acts specified in this Subsection (2) shall not preclude a

443

    
mother or child was located in this state; and
            
444

    
    (A)  he complied with the most stringent and complete requirements of the state where
            
445

    
the mother resided immediately before coming to this state, in order to protect and preserve his
            
446

    
parental interest and his rights in the child in cases of adoption; or

    [(3)] (4)  An unmarried, biological father whose consent is required under Subsection
            
452

    
(1) [or], (2), or (3) may nevertheless lose his right to consent if the court determines, in
            
453

    
accordance with the requirements and procedures of Title 78, Chapter 3a, Part 4, Termination
            
454

    
of Parental Rights Act, that his rights should be terminated, based on the petition of any
            
455

    
interested party.
            
456

    
    [(4)] (5)  If there is no showing that an unmarried, biological father has consented to or
            
457

    
waived his rights regarding a proposed adoption, the petitioner shall file with the court a
            
458

    
certificate from the state registrar of vital statistics within the Department of Health, stating
            
459

    
that a diligent search has been made of the registry of notices from unmarried biological fathers
            
460

    
described in Subsection (2)(b)(ii), and that no filing has been found pertaining to the father of
            
461

    
the child in question, or if a filing is found, stating the name of the putative father and the time

            
462


    
and date of filing.  That certificate shall be filed with the court prior to entrance of a final

    [(5)] (6)  An unmarried, biological father who does not fully and strictly comply with
            
465

    
each of the conditions provided in this section, is deemed to have waived and surrendered any
            
466

    
right in relation to the child, including the right to notice of any judicial proceeding in
            
467

    
connection with the adoption of the child, and his consent to the adoption of the child is not 
            
468

    
required.
            
469

    
    Section 6.  
Section  
78-30-4.15

 is amended to read:
            
470

    
     78-30-4.15.  Responsibility of each party for own actions -- Fraud or
            
471

    
 misrepresentation -- Statutory compliance.
            
472

    
    (1)  Each parent of a child conceived or born outside of marriage is responsible for his
            
473

    
or her own actions and is not excused from strict compliance with the provisions of this 
            
474

    
chapter based upon any action, statement, or omission of the other parent or third parties.
            
475

    
    (2)  Any person injured by fraudulent representations or actions in connection with an
            
476

    
adoption is entitled to pursue civil or criminal penalties in accordance with existing law.  A
            
477

    
fraudulent representation is not a defense to strict compliance with the requirements of this
            
478

    
chapter, and is not a basis for dismissal of a petition for adoption, vacation of an adoption
            
479

    
decree, or an automatic grant of custody to the offended party.  Custody determinations shall be
            
480

    
based on the best interest of the child, in accordance with the provisions of Section 

78-30-4.16

.
            
481

    
    (3)  The Legislature finds no practical way to remove all risk of fraud or
            
482

    
misrepresentation in adoption proceedings, and has provided a method for absolute protection
            
483

    
of an unmarried, biological father's rights by compliance with the provisions of this chapter.  In
            
484

    
balancing the rights and interests of the state, and of all parties affected by fraud, specifically
            
485

    
the child, the adoptive parents, and the unmarried, biological father, the Legislature has
            
486

    
determined that the unmarried, biological father is in the best position to prevent or ameliorate
            
487

    
the effects of fraud and that, therefore, the burden of fraud shall be borne by him.
            
488

    
    [(4)  The Legislature finds that an unmarried biological father who resides in another
            
489

    
state may not, in every circumstance, be reasonably presumed to know of, and strictly comply
            
490

    
with, the requirements of this chapter.  Therefore when all of the following requirements have
            
491

    
been met, that unmarried biological father may contest an adoption, prior to finalization of the
            
492

    
decree of adoption, and assert his interest in the child; the court may then, in its discretion,

            
493


    
proceed with an evidentiary hearing under Subsection 

78-30-4.16

(2):]
            
494

    
    [(a)  the unmarried biological father resides and has resided in another state where the
            
495

    
unmarried mother was also located or resided;]
            
496

    
    [(b)  the mother left that state without notifying or informing the unmarried biological
            
497

    
father that she could be located in the state of Utah;]
            
498

    
    [(c)  the unmarried biological father has, through every reasonable means, attempted to
            
499

    
locate the mother but does not know or have reason to know that the mother is residing in the
            
500

    
state of Utah; and]
            
501

    
    [(d)  the unmarried biological father has complied with the most stringent and complete
            
502

    
requirements of the state where the mother previously resided or was located, in order to
            
503

    
protect and preserve his parental interest and right in the child in cases of adoption.]
            
504

    
    Section 7.  
Section  
78-30-4.16

 is amended to read:
            
505

    
     78-30-4.16.  Contested adoptions -- Rights of parties -- Determination of custody.
            
506

    
    [(1)  Whenever any party contests an adoption, the court shall first determine whether
            
507

    
the provisions of this chapter have been complied with.  If a party who was entitled to notice
            
508

    
and consent under the provisions of this chapter, was denied that right, and did not otherwise
            
509

    
waive or forfeit that right  under the terms of this chapter, the court may:]
            
510

    
    [(a)  enjoin the adoption, or dismiss the adoption petition, and proceed in accordance
            
511

    
with Subsection (2); or]
            
512

    
    [(b)  determine whether proper grounds for termination of that parent's rights exist and,
            
513

    
if so, order that the parent's rights be terminated in accordance with the provisions of this
            
514

    
chapter or Title 78, Chapter 3a, Part 4, Termination of Parental Rights Act.]
            
515

    
    [(2) (a)  In any case, and under any circumstance, if a court determines that a petition
            
516

    
for adoption may not be granted, the court may not automatically grant custody of a child to a
            
517

    
challenging biological parent, but shall conduct an evidentiary hearing in each case, in order to
            
518

    
determine who should have custody of the child, in accordance with the child's best interest.]
            
519

    
    [(b)  Evidence considered at that hearing may include, but is not limited to, evidence of
            
520

    
psychological or emotional bonds that the child had formed with third parties and any
            
521

    
detriment that a change in custody may cause to the child.  The fact that a person relinquished a
            
522

    
child to a licensed child placing agency or executed a consent for adoption may not be
            
523

    
considered by the court as evidence of neglect or abandonment.]

            
524


    
    (1)  If a person whose consent for an adoption is required pursuant to Subsection
            
525

    


78-30-4.14

(1)(b), (c), (d), (e), or (f) refused to consent, the court shall determine whether
            
526

    
proper grounds exist for the termination of that person's rights pursuant to the provisions of this
            
527

    
chapter or Title 78, Chapter 3a, Part 4, Termination of Parental Rights Act.
            
528

    
    (2)  If there are proper grounds to terminate the person's parental rights, the court shall
            
529

    
order that the person's rights be terminated.  If there are not proper grounds to terminate the
            
530

    
person's parental rights, the court shall:
            
531

    
    (a)  dismiss the adoption petition; and
            
532

    
    (b)  conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine who should have custody of the child
            
533

    
and award custody in accordance with the child's best interest.
            
534

    
    (3)  Evidence considered at the custody hearing may include evidence of psychological
            
535

    
or emotional bonds that the child has formed with a third person, including the prospective
            
536

    
adoptive parent, and any detriment that a change in custody may cause the child.
            
537

    
    (4)  The fact that a person relinquished a child to a licensed child-placing agency or
            
538

    
consented to the adoption may not be considered as evidence that the person:
            
539

    
    (a)  is unfit or incompetent to be a parent;
            
540

    
    (b)  has neglected or abandoned the child;
            
541

    
    (c)  is not interested in having custody of the child; or
            
542

    
    (d)  should not be granted custody because based on any of the above considerations it
            
543

    
would not be in the child's best interest.
            
544

    
    [(c)] (5)  Any custody order entered pursuant to this section may also include provisions
            
545

    
for parent-time by a biological parent or visitation by an interested third party, and provide for
            
546

    
the financial support of the child.
            
547

    
    (6)  If a person or entity whose consent is required for an adoption under Subsection
            
548

    


78-30-4.14

(1)(a) or (g) refuses to consent, the court shall proceed with an evidentiary hearing
            
549

    
and award custody as set forth in Subsection (2).  The court may also finalize the adoption if
            
550

    
doing so is in the best interest of the child.
            
551

    
    [(3)] (7)  An adoption may not be contested after the final decree of adoption is entered.
            
552

    
    Section 8.

    (1)  A consent or relinquishment by a birth mother or an adoptee shall be signed before:

            
555


    
    (a)  a judge of any court that has jurisdiction over adoption proceedings, or a [public
            
556

    
officer] person appointed by that judge for the purpose of taking consents or relinquishments;

or

560

    
not members of the birth mother's immediate family.
