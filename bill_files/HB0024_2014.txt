commissioner finds that:

1767

    
insurance for which it is presently licensed;

1778

    
    (v)  the plans or proposals which the acquiring party has to liquidate the insurer, sell its
            
1779

    
assets, or consolidate or merge it with any person, or to make any other material change in its

1783

    
    (vi)  the competence, experience, and integrity of those persons who would control the
