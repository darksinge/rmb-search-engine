 Legislative Review Note
    as of   2-3-14  5:28 PM

The Utah Legislature's Joint Rule 4-2-402 requires legislative general counsel to place a

legislative review note on legislation. The Legislative Management Committee has further
directed legislative general counsel to include legal analysis in the legislative review note only
if legislative general counsel determines there is a high probability that a court would declare
the legislation to be unconstitutional under the Utah Constitution, the United States
Constitution, or both. As explained in the legal analysis below, legislative general counsel has
determined, based on applicable state and federal constitutional language and current
interpretations of that language in state and federal court case law, that this legislation has a
high probability of being declared unconstitutional by a court.

This bill: (1) defines hemp extract as an extract of the cannabis plant or a mixture containing
cannabis plant material that contains less than 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol by weight and
contains no other psychoactive substance; (2) gives the Utah Department of Health the
authority to issue authorization cards to individuals who, based on a statement from a
physician, could benefit from treatment by hemp extract or to individuals caring for a minor
who, based on a statement from a physician, could benefit from treatment by hemp extract; (3)
allows an authorized individual to use or possess hemp extract; and (4) allows an authorized
individual to administer hemp extract to a minor.

The federal Controlled Substances Act defines “marihuana” as “all parts of the plant Cannabis
sativa L., whether growing or not,” and only exempts a compound or other mixture made from
the “mature stalks” or sterilized seeds of the plant.  21 U.S.C. § 802(16) (2014).  The act lists
marihuana as a controlled substance and makes it illegal to possess a controlled substance
without a prescription, or to possess a controlled substance with intent to distribute the
substance.  Id. at §§ 841, 844. 

Under the Supremacy Clause in the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. Supreme Court has “long
recognized that state laws that conflict with federal law are without effect.”  Altira Group v.
Good, 555 U.S. 70 (2008).  Federal law limits preemption under the federal Controlled
Substances Act to those cases where a “positive conflict” exists between the Act and a state
law, such that it is impossible for a party to comply with both state and federal requirements. 
See 21 U.S.C. § 903; Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U.S. 51, 64 (2002).

Under the definition used in this bill, substances that meet the bill's definition of hemp extract
need not be made exclusively from the mature stalks or sterilized seeds of the cannabis plant,
and therefore are likely to be considered “marihuana” under the federal Controlled Substances
Act.  Any substance that meets the federal Controlled Substances Act's definition of marihuana
will trigger the possession and distribution prohibitions contained in the Act.  An individual
possessing or using hemp extract or administering hemp extract to a minor likely could not
comply with the provisions of this bill without also violating federal law, creating a positive
conflict with the bill and federal law.  That positive conflict results in a high probability that a
court will hold that the bill is preempted by federal law and unconstitutional under the
Supremacy Clause.
