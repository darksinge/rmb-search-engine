A smoke detector shall be installed on any ceiling or wall in the hallway2567     or space communicating with each bedroom area between the living area and the first bedroom2568     door, unless a door separates the living area from that bedroom area, in which case the detector2569     shall be installed on the living-area side, as close to the door as practicable, as required by2570     MHCSS 3280.208.  Homes with bedroom areas separated by any one or combination of2571     common-use areas such as a kitchen, dining room, living room, or family room (but not a2572     bathroom or utility room) shall be required to have one detector for each bedroom area.  When2573     located in the hallways, the detector shall be between the return air intake and the living areas.2574          (b)  Switches and electrical connections.  Smoke detectors shall have no switches in the2575     circuit to the detector between the over-current protection device protecting the branch circuit2576     and the detector.

A listed, factory-built chimney designed to be attached directly to the2589     fireplace/fireplace stove and equipped with, in accordance with the listing, a termination device2590     and spark arrester shall be required.  The chimney shall extend at least three feet above the part2591     of the roof through which it passes and at least two feet above the highest elevation of any part2592     of the manufactured home that is within 10 feet of the chimney.2593          (ii)  Air-intake assembly and combustion-air inlet.  An air-intake assembly shall be2594     installed in accordance with the terms of listings and the manufacturer's instruction.  A2595     combustion-air inlet shall conduct the air directly into the fire chamber and shall be designed to2596     prevent material from the hearth from dropping on the area beneath the manufactured home.2597          (iii)  Hearth.  The hearth extension shall be of noncombustible material that is a2598     minimum of 3/8-inch thick and shall extend a minimum of 16 inches in front and eight inches2599     beyond each side of the fireplace/fireplace stove opening.  The hearth shall also extend over the2600     entire surface beneath a fireplace stove and beneath an elevated and overhanging fireplace.2601          (5)  Related to electrical wiring systems:2602          (a)  Testing.  All electrical systems shall be tested for continuity in accordance with2603     MHCSS 3280.810, to ensure that metallic parts are properly bonded; tested for operation, to2604     demonstrate that all equipment is connected and in working order; and given a polarity check,2605     to determine that connections are proper.2606          (b)  5.2 Protection.  The electrical system shall be properly protected for the required2607     amperage load.  If the unit wiring employs aluminum conductors, all receptacles and switches2608     rated at 20 amperes or less that are directly connected to the aluminum conductors shall be2609     marked CO/ALA.  Exterior receptacles, other than heat tape receptacles, shall be of the2610     ground-fault circuit interrupter (GCI) type.  Conductors of dissimilar metals (copper/aluminum2611     or copper-clad aluminum) must be connected in accordance with NEC, Section 110-14.2612          (6)  Related to replacement furnaces and water heaters:2613          (a)  Listing.

Furnaces and water heaters shall be installed to provide complete2620     separation of the combustion system from the interior atmosphere of the manufactured home,2621     as required by MHCSS.2622          (i)  Separation.  The required separation may be achieved by the installation of2623     direct-vent system (sealed combustion system) furnace or water heater or the installation of2624     furnace and water heater venting and combustion systems from the interior atmosphere of the2625     home.  There shall be no doors, grills, removable access panels, or other openings into the2626     enclosure from the inside of the manufactured home.  All openings for ducts, piping, wiring,2627     etc., shall be sealed.2628          (ii)  Water heater.  The floor area in the area of the water heater shall be free from2629     damage from moisture to ensure that the floor will support the weight of the water heater.2630          Section 38.
