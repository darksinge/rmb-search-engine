and2467          (ii)  submitting to jurisdiction under Section 31A-2-309;2468          (b)  having irrevocably appointed the commissioner as the domestic ceding insurer's2469     agent for service of process in an action arising out of or in connection with the reinsurance,2470     which appointment is made under Section 31A-2-309; or2471          (c)  agreeing in the reinsurance contract:2472          (i)  that if the assuming insurer fails to perform its obligations under the terms of the2473     reinsurance contract, the assuming insurer, at the request of the ceding insurer, shall:2474          (A)  submit to the jurisdiction of a court of competent jurisdiction in a state of the2475     United States;2476          (B)  comply with all requirements necessary to give the court jurisdiction; and2477          (C)  abide by the final decision of the court or of an appellate court in the event of an2478     appeal; and2479          (ii)  to designate the commissioner or a specific attorney licensed to practice law in this2480     state as its attorney upon whom may be served lawful process in an action, suit, or proceeding2481     instituted by or on behalf of the ceding company.2482          [(9)] (10)  Submitting to the jurisdiction of Utah courts under Subsection [(8)] (9) does2483     not override a duty or right of a party under the reinsurance contract, including a requirement2484     that the parties arbitrate their disputes.2485          [(10)] (11)  If an assuming insurer does not meet the requirements of Subsection (3),2486     (4), or (5), the credit permitted by Subsection (6) or (8) may not be allowed unless the2487     assuming insurer agrees in the trust instrument to the following conditions:2488          (a) (i)  Notwithstanding any other provision in the trust instrument, if an event2489     described in Subsection [(10)] (11)(a)(ii) occurs the trustee shall comply with:2490          (A)  an order of the commissioner with regulatory oversight over the trust; or2491          (B)  an order of a court of competent jurisdiction directing the trustee to transfer to the2492     commissioner with regulatory oversight all of the assets of the trust fund.2493          (ii)  This Subsection [(10)] (11)(a) applies if:2494          (A)  the trust fund is inadequate because the trust contains an amount less than the2495     amount required by Subsection (6)(d); or2496          (B)  the grantor of the trust is:2497          (I)  declared insolvent; or2498          (II)  placed into receivership, rehabilitation, liquidation, or similar proceeding under the2499     laws of its state or country of domicile.2500          (b)  The assets of a trust fund described in Subsection [(10)] (11)(a) shall be distributed2501     by and a claim shall be filed with and valued by the commissioner with regulatory oversight in2502     accordance with the laws of the state in which the trust is domiciled that are applicable to the2503     liquidation of a domestic insurance company.2504          (c)  If the commissioner with regulatory oversight determines that the assets of the trust2505     fund, or any part of the assets, are not necessary to satisfy the claims of the one or more United2506     States ceding insurers of the grantor of the trust, the assets, or a part of the assets, shall be2507     returned by the commissioner with regulatory oversight to the trustee for distribution in2508     accordance with the trust instrument.2509          (d)  A grantor shall waive any right otherwise available to it under United States law2510     that is inconsistent with this Subsection [(10)] (11).2511          (12)  If an accredited or certified reinsurer ceases to meet the requirements for2512     accreditation or certification, the commissioner may suspend or revoke the reinsurer's2513     accreditation or certification.2514          (a)  The commissioner shall give the reinsurer notice and opportunity for hearing.2515          (b)  The suspension or revocation may not take effect until after the commissioner's2516     order after a hearing, unless:2517          (i)  the reinsurer waives its right to hearing;2518          (ii)  the commissioner's order is based on:2519          (A)  regulatory action by the reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction; or2520          (B)  the voluntary surrender or termination of the reinsurer's eligibility to transact2521     insurance or reinsurance business in its domiciliary jurisdiction or primary certifying state2522     under Subsection (8)(g); or2523          (iii)  the commissioner's finding that an emergency requires immediate action and a2524     court of competent jurisdiction has not stayed the commissioner's action.2525          (c)  While a reinsurer's accreditation or certification is suspended, no reinsurance2526     contract issued or renewed after the effective date of the suspension qualifies for credit except2527     to the extent that the reinsurer's obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with2528     Section 31A-17-404.1.2529          (d)  If a reinsurer's accreditation or certification is revoked, no credit for reinsurance2530     may be granted after the effective date of the revocation except to the extent that the reinsurer's2531     obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with Subsection (8)(f) or Section2532     31A-17-404.1.2533          (13) (a)  A ceding insurer shall take steps to manage its reinsurance recoverables2534     proportionate to its own book of business.2535          (b) (i)  A domestic ceding insurer shall notify the commissioner within 30 days after2536     reinsurance recoverables from any single assuming insurer, or group of affiliated assuming2537     insurers:2538          (A)  exceeds 50% of the domestic ceding insurer's last reported surplus to2539     policyholders;
