Scenic River System, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 1271 et seq., are submitted to the state for review and
            
149

    
action by the Legislature and governor, and the results, in support of or in opposition to, are
            
150

    
included in any planning documents or other proposals for addition and are forwarded to the
            
151

    
United States Congress;

            
152


    
    (c)  the state's support for designation of an Area of Critical Environmental Concern
            
153

    
(ACEC), as defined in 43 U.S.C. Sec. 1702, within federal land management plans will be
            
154

    
withheld until:
            
155

    
    (i)  it is clearly demonstrated that the proposed area contains historic, cultural or scenic
            
156

    
values, fish or wildlife resources, or natural processes which are unique or substantially
            
157

    
significant on a regional basis, or contain natural hazards which significantly threaten human
            
158

    
life or safety;
            
159

    
    (ii)  the regional values, resources, processes, or hazards have been analyzed by the
            
160

    
federal agency for impacts resulting from potential actions which are consistent with the
            
161

    
multiple-use, sustained-yield principles, and that this analysis describes the rationale for any
            
162

    
special management attention required to protect, or prevent irreparable damage to the values,
            
163

    
resources, processes or hazards;
            
164

    
    (iii)  the difference between special management attention required for an ACEC and
            
165

    
normal multiple-use management has been identified and justified, and that any determination
            
166

    
of irreparable damage has been analyzed and justified for short and long term horizons;
            
167

    
    (iv)  it is clearly demonstrated that the proposed designation is not a substitute for a
            
168

    
wilderness suitability recommendation; and
            
169

    
    (v)  the conclusions of all studies are submitted to the state for review, and the results,
            
170

    
in support of or in opposition to, are included in all planning documents;
            
171

    
    (d)  sufficient federal lands are made available for government-to-government
            
172

    
exchanges of school and institutional trust lands and federal lands without regard for a
            
173

    
resource-to-resource correspondence between the surface or mineral characteristics of the
            
174

    
offered trust lands and the offered federal lands;
            
175

    
    (e)  federal agencies should support government-to-government exchanges of land with
            
176

    
the state based on a fair process of valuation which meets the fiduciary obligations of both the
            
177

    
state and federal governments toward trust lands management, and which assures that revenue
            
178

    
authorized by federal statute to the state from mineral or timber production, present or future, is
            
179

    
not diminished in any manner during valuation, negotiation, or implementation processes;
            
180

    
    (f)  prime agricultural lands should continue to produce the food and fiber needed by
            
181

    
the citizens of the state and the nation, and the rural character and open landscape of rural Utah
            
182

    
should be preserved through a healthy and active agricultural industry, consistent with private

            
183


    
property rights and state fiduciary duties;
            
184

    
    (g)  the resources of the forests and rangelands of the state should be integrated as part
            
185

    
of viable, robust, and sustainable state and local economies, and available forage should be
            
186

    
evaluated for the full complement of herbivores the rangelands can support in a sustainable
            
187

    
manner, and forests should contain a diversity of timber species, and disease or insect
            
188

    
infestations in forests should be controlled using logging or other best management practices;
            
189

    
    (h)  the invasion of noxious weeds and undesirable invasive plant species into Utah
            
190

    
should be reversed, their presence eliminated, and their return prevented;
            
191

    
    (i)  management and resource-use decisions by federal land management and regulatory
            
192

    
agencies concerning the vegetative resources within the state should reflect serious
            
193

    
consideration of the optimization of the yield of water within the watersheds of Utah;
            
194

    
    (j)  the development of the solid, fluid, and gaseous mineral resources of the state
            
195

    
should be encouraged, the waste of fluid and gaseous minerals within developed areas should
            
196

    
be prohibited, and requirements to mitigate or reclaim mineral development projects should be
            
197

    
based on credible evidence of significant impacts to natural or cultural resources;
            
198

    
    (k)  motorized, human and animal-powered outdoor recreation should be integrated into
            
199

    
a fair and balanced allocation of resources within the historical and cultural framework of
            
200

    
multiple-uses in rural Utah, and outdoor recreation should be supported as part of a balanced
            
201

    
plan of state and local economic support and growth;
            
202

    
    (l)  off-highway vehicles should be used responsibly, and the management of
            
203

    
off-highway vehicles should be uniform across all jurisdictions, and laws related to the use of
            
204

    
off-highway vehicles should be uniformly applied across all jurisdictions;
            
205

    
    (m)  rights-of-way granted under the provisions of R. S. 2477 should be preserved and
            
206

    
acknowledged;
            
207

    
    (n)  transportation and access provisions for all other existing routes, roads and trails
            
208

    
across federal, state, and school trust lands within the state should be determined and
            
209

    
identified, and agreements executed and implemented, as necessary to fully authorize and
            
210

    
determine responsibility for maintenance of all routes, roads, and trails;
            
211

    
    (o)  the reasonable development of new routes and trails for motorized, human and
            
212

    
animal-powered recreation should be implemented; and
            
213

    
    (p) (i)  forests, rangelands, and watersheds, in a healthy condition, are necessary and

            
214


    
beneficial for wildlife, livestock grazing, and other multiple-uses;
            
215

    
    (ii)  that management programs and initiatives which are implemented to increase
            
216

    
forage for the mutual benefit of the agricultural industry, livestock operations, and wildlife
            
217

    
species should utilize all proven techniques and tools;
            
218

    
    (iii)  that provisions for predator control initiatives or programs under the direction of
            
219

    
state and local authorities should be implemented; and
            
220

    
    (iv)  that resource-use and management decisions by federal land management and
            
221

    
regulatory agencies should support state sponsored initiatives or programs designed to stabilize
            
222

    
wildlife populations that may be experiencing a scientifically-demonstrated decline in those
            
223

    
populations.
            
224

    
    [(4)] (7)  Nothing contained in this section may be construed to restrict or supersede the
            
225

    
planning powers conferred upon state departments, agencies, [or] instrumentalities, or advisory
            
226

    
councils of the state or the planning powers conferred upon political subdivisions by any other
            
227

    
existing law.
